GENAN PELLETS

GENAN PELLETS, also known as GENAN SAFE, are manufactured through a patented, mechanical process and are uniform and size-specific.
GENAN SAFE rubber pellets are ideal for playground base layers, offering numerous advantages:

Guaranteed availability | Consistent quality | Steel- & dust-free
Easy on-site installation | No compaction | Less binder needed
Low bulk density | Outstanding HIC values | Excellent water permeability

HIGH SHOCK-ABSORPTION

GENAN PELLETS are made from Genan rubber powder from end-of-life tires. Pellets are a most homogeneous product  manufactured with a specific diameter and cut off to a specific length. The diameter of 
GENAN PELLETS 4.2 / 5
 is 4.2 mm, and pellets are 5 mm long. The diameter of 
GENAN PELLETS 3.8 / 35
 is 3.8 mm, and pellets are 35 mm long. The diameter of 
GENAN PELLETS 7.0 / 35
 is 7 mm, and pellets are 35 mm long.

When pellets are laid out, cavities inevitably arise, ensuring excellent water permeability, and creating the optimum conditions for the elastic properties and the energy absorption of the rubber pellets. As GENAN PELLETS are so uniform in shape, they have less surface area than traditional granulate. This results in low end-product bulk density, improved elasticity and minimum compaction.

Compared to traditional base layers made with granulate, base layers made with GENAN PELLETS require less binder. Material savings may be up to 30% for binder.

OUTSTANDING HIC VALUES

Paramount for playground surfaces is of course that children playing are as safe as possible. Especially from high fall heights, the performance of base layers is put to the test.

When testing playground surfaces constructed for an approved fall height of e.g. 10 ft, surfaces with base layers made with GENAN SAFE rubber pellets boast remarkably better results than surfaces with base layers made with traditional granulate. With GENAN SAFE pellets, HIC values below the maximum limit of 1,000 can thus be achieved with a thinner layer.

These excellent results are indeed revolutionary for playground surfacing.
