PURETi treated roads, bridges and buildings use sunlight to eat smog and become solutions to pollution.


Concrete, asphalt and other building materials  treated with PURETi and exposed to light - actively and continuously reduce the indirect greenhouse gases (NOx and SOx) and air pollutants that cause smog. The impact is powerful. Under laboratory conditions, PURETi-treated surfaces can destroy up to 70% of the pollution they touch.
