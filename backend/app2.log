The investigator can decide to withdraw a subject from the study for urgent medical reasons. There will be no replacement of individuals after withdrawal from the study as the sample size is adjusted regarding dropouts and missing data.\r\n11.4 Arrangements for subjects after their participation in the clinical trial ended\r\nWe will unblind the treatment arm for the individual patient 6 months after the last visit of each patient to ensure that the first infusion outside of the trial will be similar to the compound that the patient has received during the trial. Consequently most patients will be unblinded before the last visit of the last patient.\r\n12. SAFETY REPORTING\r\n12.1 Definitions\r\n12.1.1 Adverse events (AEs)\n\n18.

Mitoxantrone is allowed if used > 1 year before enrolment. If any of these medications have been used for indications other than MS, patients can be included if the medications have not been used the year before enrolment. Previous treatment with natalizumab is allowed (in for example cases that switch from natalizumab to anti-CD20 therapy because of JCV positivity).\r\nPrior/Concurrent Clinical Study Experience\n\n7) Physical examination includes recording of height (at screening) and body weight\r\n8) Vital signs includes the recording of body temperature, blood pressure and heart rate\r\n9) For the screening visit; safety blood analysis results from samples up to 1 week prior to screening may be used.

ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS\r\n11.1 Regulation statement\r\nThe study will be conducted according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki (WORLD MEDICAL ASSOCIATION DECLARATION OF HELSINKI Ethical Principles for Medical Research Involving Human Subjects, amended by the 64th WMA General Assembly, Fortaleza, Brazil, October 2013) and in accordance with the Medical Research Involving Human Subjects Act (WMO) and other guidelines, regulations and Acts.\r\n11.2 Recruitment and consent\r\nEligible patients will be informed shortly about the study by the supervising cardiologist or by the attending resident.\n\n11.2 Recruitment and consent\r\nEligible patients will be informed shortly about the study by the supervising cardiologist or by the attending resident.\r\nSubsequently, a trained research nurse or investigator will inform the patient in detail prior to the treatment, leaving him/her sufficient time to consider. Subsequently, the patient can think about participation and discuss the study with his/her family. After this period of consideration, the patient is asked to decide about participation. In case of participation, the informed consent form should be signed prior to randomization. This process is handled by the research nurse or investigator\r\n11.3 Benefits and risks assessment, group relatedness\r\nSee also the Introduction and Rationale of this research protocol.\n\n14\r\n10.

CHA2DS2VASc score \u22657\r\n6.4 Sample size calculation\r\nWe used a web-based power calculator based on Sample Size Calculations in Clinical Research by Chow, Shao and Wang.22,23\n\nUnpublished data from our FORCE-ACS study reveals that approximately 7% of the patients with an ACS are treated with OAC for AF. With around 34.000 patients with myocardial infarction per year, roughly 2400 patients will be eligible for inclusion per year in the Netherlands. With an estimated inclusion rate of 35% we will be able to include 840 patients per year, excluding elective PCI patients, which will be about the same amount. So the expected recruitment time when enrolled in all PCI centres will be 3 years. With one year of initiation time to expand to the other clinics and 1 year for follow-up we expect a total study duration of 5 years.\r\n6.2 Inclusion criteria\r\nIn order to be eligible to participate in this study, a subject must meet all of the following criteria:\r\n1. \u226518 years of age\r\n2.

One member is chair of the DSMB. After the inclusion of 500 patients and their 6-week follow up data being completed, tables containing patient characteristics and outcomes will be presented to the DSMB. The DSMB will discuss these data and might request additional data or might decide upon performing an interim analysis. In case of a P-value of less than 0.0294 (Pocock approach) the DSMB will weigh the potential risks and benefits to patients in the study. For this judgment the DSMB will request additional data and these will be presented to the DSMB. Finally, the DSMB will give recommendations to the (co)-project leaders on the further conduction of the trial. Should the sponsor decide not to fully implement the advice of the DSMB, the sponsor will send the advice to the reviewing METC, including a note to substantiate why the advice of the DSMB will not be followed.

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS\r\n10.1 Descriptive statistics\r\nCategorical data will be presented as patients and percentages. Continuous data will be presented as means and standard deviations or as median and ranges in case data are not normally distributed.\r\n10.2 Primary study endpoints\r\nBoth the primary endpoints will be analyzed as follows: the primary analysis will compare the treatment groups from the time of randomization to the first occurrence of any event in the composite endpoint using Kaplan-Meier cumulative event-free curves and formal statistical testing by means of the log-rank test. For measure of the treatment effect we will use the hazard ratio computed with a Cox proportional hazard regression.\n\nThe sponsor will notify the METC immediately of a temporary halt of the study, including the reason of such an action.\r\nIn case the study is ended prematurely, the sponsor will notify the accredited METC within 15 days, including the reasons for the premature termination.\r\nWithin year after the end of the study, the investigator/sponsor will submit a final study report with the results of the study, including any publications/abstracts of the study, to the accredited METC.\r\nNL81102.100.22 WOEST-3 trial protocol v2.0 – 25-10-2022\r\n28\r\nPublic disclosure and publication policy\n\nNL81102.100.22 WOEST-3 trial protocol v2.0 – 25-10-2022\r\n26\r\n12. ADMINISTRATIVE ASPECTS, MONITORING AND PUBLICATION\r\n12.1 Handling and storage of data and documents\r\nThe investigator is required to maintain adequate records to enable the conduct of the study to be fully documented. Documents used for the conduct of the study (e.g. patient files, CRFs, originals of test results, Study Files) must be kept on file by the investigator for a period of 25 years.\r\nData stored in the eCRF (REDCap) will be anonymous. Every enrolled patient will have a study code which can only be linked to the patient through a patient identification file. This patient identification file will contain the anonymized study codes and patient name, date of birth, and patient number, hospital and date of inclusion. This file will be password-protected, and can be accessed by the involved researchers.\n\nThe dataset will consist both of data on the medical history and baseline of the patient and new data collected during follow-up. Medical history and baseline will be directly entered in the eCRF. Follow-up data will be collected on printed questionnaires or directly entered into the eCRF via digital questionnaires.\r\nThe eCRF and printed questionnaires will be only accessible for appointed researchers and monitors during the trial. Primary responsibility for access to data both printed and in the eCRF is appointed to the prinicipal investigator, and thereafter the coordinating investigator.\r\nThe data will belong to the St. Antonius Hospital Nieuwegein, the Netherlands. After the study is completed, the responsible for access to the data will be with the principal investigator of the trial.\r\n12.2 Monitoring and Quality Assurance\r\nSee Appendix III\r\n12.3 Amendments\n\n8.4 Withdrawal of individual subjects\r\nSubjects can leave the study at any time for any reason if they wish to do so without any consequences. The investigator can decide to withdraw a subject from the study for urgent medical reasons.\r\n8.5 Replacement of individual subjects after withdrawal\r\nAfter withdrawal, patients will not be replaced by others. Their randomisation number will not be re-used.\r\n8.6 Follow-up of subjects withdrawn from treatment\r\nA medical specialist may, when medically necessary, start or stop the study medication or start other anti-platelet medication or anti-coagulants, without any consequences. This will not change study follow-up.\r\nBaseline\r\nFollow-up\r\n6 weeks\r\n3 months\r\n6 months\r\nInformed consent\r\nX\r\nMedical history\r\nX\r\nMedical file assessment\r\nX\r\nX\r\nX\r\nQuestionnaire\r\nX\r\nX\r\nX\r\nX\r\nAE/SAE\r\nX\r\nX\r\nX\r\nNL81102.100.22 WOEST-3 trial protocol v2.0 – 25-10-2022\r\n19\r\n8.7 Premature termination of the study\n\n- requires hospitalisation or prolongation of existing inpatients’ hospitalisation;\r\n- results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity;\r\n- is a congenital anomaly or birth defect; or\r\n- any other important medical event that did not result in any of the outcomes listed above due to medical or surgical intervention but could have been based upon appropriate judgement by the investigator.\r\nAn elective hospital admission will not be considered as a serious adverse event.\r\nEfficacy and safety endpoints as described in the sections 8.1.1, 8.1.2, and 8.1.3 will not be considered as adverse events or SAEs, except if the course or severity is according to the investigator’s judgment exceptional.\r\nAll SAEs will be reported annually in an overview list to the accredited METC that approved the protocol.

APPENDIX II - Procedures for monitoring and quality assurance (in Dutch)\r\nMonitoringplan WOEST-3 trial\r\nUitvoer van monitoring\r\nMonitoring zal uitgevoerd worden onder regie van de verrichter.\r\nFrequentie van de monitoring\r\nEr zal per centrum minimaal 1 visite per jaar gepland worden. Verder zal er voorafgaand aan de studie een “initiatie visite” en aan het einde van de studie een “close-out visite” gepland worden. Dit aantal visites kan naar boven bijgesteld worden, afhankelijk van de duur van het onderzoek, aantal proefpersonen, inclusiesnelheid en eerder geobserveerde deviaties.\r\nSource Data Verification\r\n• 100% controle op aanwezigheid en juistheid van de ingevulde Informed Consent (IC) formulieren\n\nStudy population: 2000 patients with AF who undergo PCI.\r\nIntervention: Random (1:1) allocation to one month of DAPT following PCI versus standard therapy (edoxaban + P2Y12 inhibitor, and aspirin usually limited to admission). After one month all patients will be treated with edoxaban and P2Y12 inhibitor until 6 months after randomization.\r\nMain study endpoints:\r\nPrimary safety endpoint: International Society for Thrombosis and Haemostatis (ISTH) major + clinically relevant non-major bleeding (CRNMB) at 6 weeks.\r\nPrimary efficacy endpoint: composite endpoint of all-cause death, MI, stroke, systemic embolism, and probable or definite stent thrombosis at 6 weeks.\r\nFollow up: at 6 weeks and 3 and 6 months by questionnaires and medical file reviewing.\r\nNL81102.100.22 WOEST-3 trial protocol v2.0 – 25-10-2022\r\n8\r\n3.

The used eCRF (REDCap) will allow to select type of patient (ACS or elective PCI) prior to randomization in order to stratify randomization. Randomization will be performed as soon as possible after PCI, but within 72 hours. There will be no blinding.\r\nWhen a patient is included for participation in the WOEST-3 trial, their general practitioner and pharmacist will be informed.\n\n11.4 Insurance for injury due to study treatment .............................................................24\r\n11.5 Incentives ...............................................................................................................25\r\n12.

The patients will be followed until 6 months after randomization to pick up on potential rebound effects.\r\nFor the sake of uniformity the NOAC of choice will be edoxaban for all participating patients.\r\nRandomization will be stratified by center and indication at enrolment: ACS or elective PCI.\r\nA schematic overview of the study design is presented in Figure 1.\n\nSource Data Verification\r\n• 100% controle op aanwezigheid en juistheid van de ingevulde Informed Consent (IC) formulieren\r\n• 10% controle op in- en exclusiecriteria. Indien er fout-geïncludeerde deelnemers in de studie zijn opgenomen zullen mogelijk alle dossiers van dat specifieke centrum gecontroleerd worden.\r\n• 10% van alle onderzoeksgegevens zullen gecontroleerd worden met de brondocumenten aan de hand van een van tevoren gedefinieerde lijst met variabelen, inclusief primaire eindpunten, die in duidelijke relatie staan tot de veiligheid en geldigheid van het onderzoek.\r\n• 100% verificatie geëigende meldingsprocedure van gemelde SAEs en SUSAR\r\n• 10% van de proefpersonen worden gecontroleerd op eventuele gemiste SAEs en SUSARs.\r\nAlgemene controle\r\n• Per centrum en per monitorbezoek zal de inclusiesnelheid en het uitvalpercentage worden gerapporteerd.\n\n- Low body weight \u226460 kg\r\n- Concomitant use of the following P-glycoprotein inhibitors: Ciclosporin, dronedarone, erythromycin or ketoconazole.\r\nThe choice for NOAC anticoagulation instead of VKA in this study is driven by the results of the AUGUSTUS trial which showed less bleeding complications in the NOAC group compared to the VKA group, irrespective of dual or triple therapy.27 Patients on VKA anticoagulation at presentation are not able to participate.\r\nSelection of P2Y12 inhibitor is at the discretion of the treating physician, depending on both bleeding and ischemic risk. Genotyping may be used to guide decision-making regarding choice of P2Y12 inhibitor. However, this is not mandatory. Dosage of aspirin and P2Y12 inhibitor is according to the local guidelines.\r\n7.2 Use of co-intervention\r\nThere are no co-interventions.\r\n7.3 Escape medication\r\nThere are no escape medications.\r\nNL81102.100.22 WOEST-3 trial protocol v2.0 – 25-10-2022\r\n16\r\n8. METHODS\r\n8.1 Study parameters/endpoints\n\n20. CHA2DS2VASc score \u22657\r\n6.4 Sample size calculation\r\nWe used a web-based power calculator based on Sample Size Calculations in Clinical Research by Chow, Shao and Wang.22,23\r\nBased on the AUGUSTUS trial, expected event rate in the standard treatment arm will be 7.45% at 30 days. A study by Hansen et al showed the HR for bleeding in patients treated with NOAC + clopidogrel versus DAPT versus is around 1.86.24 Thus, the expected incidence in the DAPT group will be 4.01%.\r\nFor superiority of the primary bleeding endpoint, 1962 patients are required to have a 80% chance of detecting, as significant at the 5% level, a decrease in the primary outcome measure from 7.5% in the control group to 4.5% in the experimental group.\n\nNL81102.100.22 WOEST-3 trial protocol v2.0 – 25-10-2022\r\n31\r\n31.

The primary efficacy outcome will be tested for non-inferiority. The non-inferiority margin will be 1%. Non-inferiority will be proven if one-sided p<0.025.\r\nSince both primary endpoints are necessary to evaluate the success of the tested treatment strategy we will not correct for multiple primary endpoints (as is also recommended by the European Medicines Agency and FDA30,31).\r\nThe primary analysis will be an intention-to-treat analysis. Per-protocol analysis will be used as a sensitivity analysis.\r\n10.3 Secondary study endpoints\n<END OF CONTEXT>"}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'How may I help you?'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Who is eligible for this study'}]
