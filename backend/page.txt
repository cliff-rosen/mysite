The Value We Bring Agility At our core, Radial Theory is a technology evolution accelerant for your enterprise. Expertise We bring our portfolio of know-how, acumen, tools and informed ideas to the table for each client, allowing us to scope fast-moving and high-value engagements that hit the ground at a run. Crafted Tools Radial Theory's patterns and practices are more than architecture and concepts -- they are manifest in code and configuration artifacts that we have created, curated and compiled into an ever-growing library of tools and services. Solution Recipes Our projects and solutions build upon each other, and are engineered to solve domain-specific problems in reusable, domain-agnostic ways, and this generates value and speed-to-market for all of our partners and clients. Our Core Principles Embrace Proven Practices We deliver sound and sustainable technology consulting and solutions, using industry-proven patterns and software. Value at Speed We focus our work on providing tangible value quickly and affordably. Keep Long-Term Perspective We invest in our clients' long-term technology foundation with each step taken. Derive Inspiration from Adversity We apply pragmatic fearlessness to all business and technical challenges, attacking the highest risks first. Engineer for Change We embrace open and shared standards and practices, with an eye towards evolution and sustainability. Forge Trust Through Value We invite bonds with our customers based on merit, and never on lock-in. What We Are Not A big firm We are lean by design, and plan to grow carefully and purposefully to sustain our level of experience and the quality of our work. We are able to be highly effective with low headcount because all of our team members have the experience to incorporate client relationship management while performing hands-on engineering. When necessary, we scale to meet our clients needs through carefully curated and mutually complementary partnerships. What We Are Not A company driven by profits from proprietary software licensing We believe that domain-specific, licensed, custom and shrink-wrapped software is a dying species, and that community-led software frameworks and commodity infrastructure will enable our clients to focus on their true differentiators: strategic ideas, product inventions, business rules, practices and processes.
