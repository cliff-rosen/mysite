Conversations

All calls from frontend to get_answer occurs in the context of a conversation.
Each conversation has a unique conversation_id
Front end assigns either an existing id or "NEW" for each all

If conversation_id is "NEW":
 a new 20 character conversation_id is generated
 the submitted prompt is created from create_prompt(question, chunks_with_text, prompt)
 conversation_text is set to submitted prompt + answer
 a new record is inserted into the conversation table with submitted_prompt + answer

If conversation_id is provided:
 existing conversation record is retrieved from db
 the submitted prompt is a concatation of:
    conversation_text from db + create_prompt(question, chunks_with_text, prompt)
 existing conversation record is updated with submitted_prompt + answer
 NOTE: prompt in this case should only consist of:
    Question: {query}
