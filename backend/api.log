What We Do WHC Admin 2017-10-17T06:21:07+00:00 We are a boutique home technology integrator serving the high end residential market in NYC and surrounding areas. Our job as a home technology integrator is to provide technology that maximizes the usefulness of your home while seamlessly integrating with your home’s architecture. While we work with a broad array of technology applications, the key applications featured in most of our projects include: Home Networking / WiFi Smart Lighting HVAC (Heating and Air Conditioning) Video / Distributed Video / Home Theater Audio / Distributed Audio Motorized Shades Surveillance These applications are all seamlessly tied together with a “central brain” or controller. Our platform of choice for this controller is Control4. We are a full service design-build firm, but also are happy to work in a design or consulting capacity.

Lighting that is not only very easy to control, but also more architecturally friendly because “keypads” now replace large, unsightly banks of light switches. Video and audio systems that give you the sights and sounds you want without so much gear cluttering your space and certainly without any visible wires. “Orchestrated control” of lights, audio, video, security, heating and cooling, door locks, etc. In other words, you can easily change the state of any or all of these systems together with a single button press, a scheduled event, etc. Control over these systems from a phone or tablet, whether you are sitting on the Great Room couch or half way around the world. To be sure, the list goes on. But, if you start with these ideas in mind as you build your new home, you are headed in the right direction to make it a smart home. By WHC Admin|
