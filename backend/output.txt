QUERY: what is bayesian dosing

RESPONSE: Bayesian dosing is a statistical method used to determine the probability of an event occurring based on conditions placed on the event and past data. It is used to calculate a precise dose to achieve a clinical target, resulting in significant improvements to mortality, risk, and patient outcomes. Bayesian dosing software uses published population models that take into account patient details, such as height, weight, sex, and genotype, to calculate an individualized dosing recommendation.

QUERY: what kind of decisions does your software help me to make in my practice

RESPONSE: Our software helps you to make decisions about individualizing doses for patients, managing risk across multiple sites, predicting future trough concentrations, and avoiding potential problems. It can also help you to identify issues in a given unit and improve your resource allocation.

=======================================

QUERY: How does your software helps meto make decisions about individualizing doses for patients, managing risk across multiple sites, predicting future trough concentrations, and avoiding potential problems

RESPONSE: Our software helps to make decisions about individualizing doses for patients by leveraging clinically validated pharmacokinetic drug models, patient characteristics, patient genotype information and exact patient responses to the drug dosed (via drug concentrations) to guide dose optimization. It can also be used to manage risk across multiple sites by providing a clinical risk dashboard which looks at levels that have already been done, and uses charted orders to predict future trough concentrations which can be related to adverse drug event risk, as well as predicting patients who will have super therapeutic dosing. This clinical decision support can also be used to avoid potential problems and highlight issues in a given unit, helping to improve resource allocation.
