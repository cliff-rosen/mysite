While there were many great learnings from this survey, several insights immediately caught our attention. First, only 15% of those surveyed expect disruption to business to be 90 days or longer, and the remainder estimated 60 days or less. Next, we were particularly interested in understanding how the industry is responding to the grounding of sales teams—responses revealed that nearly 70% of the companies represented in our survey are exploring new learning and development initiatives to support their sales teams. Many of those are looking for opportunities to strengthen “soft skills” and non–product-related sales skills. Finally, when asked if they had formally or informally connected with their HCP customers to understand their needs as we moved into social distancing, nearly 75% of respondents reported they had not yet taken this action. While these data are intended to serve as directional insights, it’s clear that many aspects of our business have changed or are about to change.
