ADS THAT FIGHT CLIMATE CHANGE

EnhanceAir turns any outdoor advertising media into  
an air purifying surface that reduces pollution and  
contributes to the fight against global warming.

 ◆ Transparent top coat is activated by UVA light 
 ◆ No changes to installation process
 ◆ Does not affect recyclability
 ◆ Lasts for the life of most ads

Superoxide is an oxygen 
molecule with an extra 
electron, giving it the 
ability to remediate 

certain types of pollution.

 ◆ Light energy activates the coating, turning Oxygen and Humidity into powerful cleaning agents.
 ◆ Pollutants are converted to less harmful minerals and gases.
 ◆ The coating is a catalyst, so it will continue to work for the life of most ads. 
 ◆ The cleaning process happens only at the surface and repeats as polluted air circulates.

EnhanceAir Destroys Three Types of Pollution.

NOx

Volatile Organic 

Compounds (VOCs)

Both harmful to human health 
and an indirect greenhouse gas.

Contribute to smog and many 

are toxic to humans.

Organic Surface Grime
The stuff that makes our 

ads dirty.

Why NOx?
Nitrogen oxides (NO and NO2) are formed during 
combustion. NOx is harmful in several ways:

 ◆
 ◆

It irritates airways and increases susceptibility to allergens.
It combines with other pollutants in the air to create smog, acid rain, PM2.5  
and ground level ozone, which contributes to global warming.
Increases risk of heart disease, stroke, COPD, and lung cancer.
It has a much higher Global Warming Potential than CO2.

 ◆
 ◆
 ◆ NOx is an indirect greenhouse gas. It does not trap heat directly, but leads to  

the creation of other gases, like ozone, that are greenhouse gases. 

 ◆ EnhanceAir fights climate change and improves human health by destroying  

NOx and other pollutants.  

Proven Laboratory and Real World Results

Using a test based on the ISO 22197-1 standard, we pass a fixed amount of NOx across a treated surface where the 
air is in contact with the surface for only 1 second before being replaced by new polluted air. The concentration of 
NOx is measured as it exits the chamber.

Take Credit for Helping the Planet

Because EnhanceAir lowers NOx and VOC levels, advertisers who use the coating  

can make the following claims about how they are helping the environment:

 ◆ Fights Climate Change
 ◆ Reduces Air Pollution
 ◆ Cleans the Air

Improves Air Quality

 ◆
 ◆ Helps the Planet
 ◆ Eats Smog

 ◆ Makes the Air Healthier
 ◆ Purifies the Air
 ◆ More Sustainable Advertising

More quantitative claims like car pollution offsets, tree equivalents, or gasoline 
equivalents can be estimated for each campaign based on its size and duration.
IMPORTANT NOTES: The EnhanceAir coating does not absorb pollution; it oxidizes and destroys it, 
converting it into less harmful forms. The EnhanceAir coating does not destroy CO₂. It helps reduce the 
greenhouse gas footprint, but not the carbon footprint.
