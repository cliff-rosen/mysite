9 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS (cont.)

9.4 Statistical Analyses
9.4.1 General Approach
All data will be listed, and all variables will be summarized according to their type. Variables measured
on metrical scales will be summarized using descriptive statistics (number of non-missing observations,
arithmetic mean, sample standard deviation, median, minimum, first quartile, third quartile, and
maximum). Variables measured on ordinal or nominal scales will be summarized using frequency
tables showing the number and percentage of subjects falling within a particular category.
Missing data will be handled as such, i.e., no imputation of missing data is planned.
All details of the statistical analysis will be described in more detail in a statistical analysis plan, which
will be agreed upon before database closure.
Standard of truth
The standard of truth in this study is the result of the clinical diagnosis established through histological
verification of the presence or absence of AL amyloidosis with cardiac involvement determined
through either endomyocardial biopsy or through extracardiac biopsy in conjunction with typical CMR
or echo imaging features as the standard of truth (Section 8.1.2).
9.4.2 Analysis of the Primary Endpoints(s)
The co-primary efficacy variables (sensitivity and specificity) will be evaluated using five independent
individual blinded readers. Point estimates together with 95% confidence intervals of sensitivity and
specificity (relative to the standard of truth) will be assessed for each of the 5 readers separately.
Point estimates for the sensitivity and specificity of each reader will be calculated according to the
visual assessment and the standard of truth (Section 8.1.2) as described in the table below.
Table 2. Truth table of AL cardiac amyloidosis detection
Standard of Truth
AL-CA present AL-CA absent
Visual assessment AL-pos True positive (TP) False positive (FP)
AL-neg False negative (FN) True negative (TN)
The point estimate for sensitivity (?^????) and specificity (?^????) is calculated as:
[formula removed]
Where nsens and nspec are the sample size used to estimate sensitivity and specificity.
The following hypotheses are formulated:
 H0,sens: se??siti??ity ?? 0.6 ??s. H1,sens: sensitivity > 0.6
 H0,spec: spe??ifi??ity ?? 0.6 ??s. H1,spec: specificity > 0.6

H0,sens will be rejected if the lower bound of the two-sided 95% confidence is larger than 0.6 for at least
3 out of the 5 blinded readers.
H0,spec will be rejected if the lower bound of the two-sided 95% confidence is larger than 0.6 for at least
3 out of the 5 blinded readers.
9.4.3 Analysis of the Secondary Endpoints
Receiver operating characteristic curves will be applied to assess the performance of quantitative
[18F]florbetaben PET measurements in the detection of AL cardiac amyloidosis.
Association of PET results with the parameters of left ventricular function (LV ejection fraction and LV
mass) will be assessed by means of scatter plots and correlation coefficients.
Association of PET results with the disease stage based on FLC-diff, cTnT and NT-proBNP levels1 will be
assessed by means of scatter plots and correlation coefficients. If required, cTnT may be replaced by
cTnI; NT-proBNP by BNP. The respective threshold values for disease staging are derived from recent
literature22-23:
Impact of [18F]florbetaben PET on diagnostic thinking and patient management will be assessed by
means of the change in clinical diagnosis and diagnosis confidence after intermediate PET read has
been provided to the investigator.
9.4.4 Safety Analyses
Analysis of safety parameters will include all vital signs, and AE data listed by subject. The safety
variable will be evaluated according to their scale. Continuous variables will be evaluated using
descriptive statistics. Categorical and ordinal variables will be evaluated using frequency tables.
9.4.5 Planned Interim Analyses
No interim analysis is planned.

Diagnosis and main criteria for Inclusion and Exclusion
Patients with suspected cardiac amyloidosis or with a putative diagnosis of
cardiac amyloidosis but with remaining diagnostic uncertainty (e.g. unclear
etiology and/or cardiac manifestation) or patients with diagnosis of
amyloidosis but unclear cardiac involvement will be recruited for the study.
Inclusion Criteria (for all subjects)
 Males and females age >= 18 years
 Able to understand, sign and date written informed consent
 Written informed consent must be obtained before any assessment
is performed
 Subjects being considered for a possible diagnosis of cardiac
amyloidosis by:
1. One of the following conditions:
o Established systemic amyloidosis without proven cardiac
involvement,
o Known plasma cell dyscrasia (MGUS, multiple myeloma),
o Pathological free light chain levels in urine or serum,
o Presence of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction
2. AND one of the following parameters, indicative of cardiac
manifestation:
o Mean (left ventricular (LV) wall + septum) thickness >12mm as
measured by echocardiography in absence of other known
cause of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH),
o NT-proBNP >335 ng/L
 Planned diagnostic procedures to establish diagnosis and cardiac
involvement (e.g., endomyocardial biopsy or extracardiac biopsy in
conjunction with cardiac magnetic resonance imaging/
echocardiography or bone scintigraphy)
 Female subjects must be documented by medical records or
physicians note to be either surgically sterile (by means of
hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy or bilateral oophorectomy)
or post-menopausal for at least 1 year (no menses for 12 months
without an alternative medical cause). If they are of child-bearing
potential, they must commit to use of a highly effective
contraceptive measure for one week after the PET scan (including
combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal
contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation (oral,
intravaginal or transdermal), progestogen-only hormonal
contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation (oral,
injectable or implantable), intrauterine device, intrauterine
hormone-releasing system, bilateral tubal occlusion, vasectomised
partner or sexual abstinence)
 Male subjects and their partners of childbearing potential must
commit to the use of a highly effective method of contraception for
a minimum of 90 days following each PET scan (including, for female
partners of childbearing potential, combined (estrogen and
progestogen containing) hormonal contraception associated with
inhibition of ovulation (oral, intravaginal or transdermal),
progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with
inhibition of ovulation (oral, injectable or implantable), intrauterine
device, intrauterine hormone-releasing system, bilateral tubal
occlusion, male subjects with vasectomy or sexual abstinence)
 Male subjects must commit to not donate sperm for a minimum of
90 days after the PET scan
Exclusion Criteria (for all subjects)

compound of the study drug
 Severe hepatic impairment (AST/ALT >5 x ULN; bilirubin >3 x ULN )
 Inability to lay flat for up to 60 min
 Pregnant, lactating or breastfeeding

 Having been administered a PET radiopharmaceutical within 10
radioactive half-lives prior to study drug administration in this study.

10 SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION AND OPERATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS (cont)

10.1.5 Clinical Monitoring
Clinical site monitoring is conducted by the sponsor (or sponsor representative) to ensure that the
rights and well-being of trial participants are protected, that the reported trial data are accurate,
complete, and verifiable, and that the conduct of the study is in compliance with currently approved
protocol/amendment(s), with ICH GCP and with applicable regulatory requirement(s).
A monitor (clinical research associate) will visit the site regularly during the study to check the
completeness of patient records, the accuracy of data, the adherence to the protocol and to GCP, the
progress of enrolment and to ensure that study drug is being transferred to the imaging facility,
dispensed, and accounted for according to specifications. Key study personnel must be available to
assist the monitor during these visits.
The investigator will maintain source documents for each patient in the study, consisting of case and
visit notes containing demographic and medical information, laboratory data and the results of any
other tests or assessments. All information in the database must be traceable to these source
documents in the patients file. The investigator must also keep the original informed consent form
signed by the patient (a signed copy is given to the patient).
The investigator will permit study-related monitoring, providing the monitor direct access to all
relevant source documents to confirm their consistency with the database entries. Monitoring
standards require full verification for the presence of informed consent, adherence to the
inclusion/exclusion criteria, documentation of SAEs and the recording of data that will be used for all
primary and safety variables.
Additional checks of the consistency of the source data with the database are performed according to
the study-specific monitoring plan. No information in source documents about the identity of the
subjects will be disclosed in the eCRF. Local requirements for data protection will be followed.

Safety 
Analysis of safety parameters will include all vital signs, and AE data during
PET imaging and up to the safety follow-up phone call, listed by subject.
