1.1. Synopsis
Protocol Title: A 2-Part, Multicenter, Randomized, Blinded, Active-Controlled 
Phase 2 Study to Sequentially Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy 
of BIIB091 Monotherapy and BIIB091 Combination Therapy 
With Diroximel Fumarate in Participants With Relapsing Forms 
of Multiple Sclerosis
Protocol Number: 257MS201
EU Trial Number 2022-502552-31-00
Version Number: 2.0
Name of Study Treatment: Research Name: BIIB091
Generic Name: Not applicable
Trade Names: Not applicable
Study Phase: 2
Study Indication: Relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS)
Study Rationale: BIIB091 is an orally active, potent, selective, reversible 
(noncovalent), and peripherally restricted small-molecule 
inhibitor of Brutons tyrosine kinase (BTK), a tyrosine-protein 
kinase that is a key signaling node immediately downstream of B 
cell receptor (BCR) and Fc receptor (FcR) engagement. The 
Sponsor is developing BIIB091 for the treatment of MS. 
Diroximel fumarate (DRF) is an aminoethyl ester of monomethyl 
fumarate (MMF) that undergoes presystemic hydrolysis through 
esterases to produce the active metabolite, MMF. DRF 
(BIIB098) was developed as a delayed-release, gastro-resistant 
oral treatment for relapsing MS (RMS) under the trade name 
Vumerity [ VUMERITY USPI 2022; Vumerity SmPC 2022].
The combination of the inhibition of B-cell and myeloid-cell 
activation with BIIB091 and the modulation of the 
proinflammatory properties of T cells and myeloid cells with 
DRF could have an additive or synergistic effect and result in 
transformative efficacy in suppressing central nervous system 
(CNS) inflammation. In addition, this combination therapy is 
expected to have minimal overlapping adverse effects based on Protocol 257MS201, Version 2.0

13clinical monotherapy data and nonclinical data from the 90-day 
combination toxicology study. The combination therapy also has 
minimal potential for drug-drug pharmacokinetic (PK) 
interactions. 
To characterize the clinical safety and efficacy profile of 
BIIB091 monotherapy in MS patients prior to assessment of 
BIIB091 and DRF combination therapy, this adaptive study 
design consists of 2 sequential parts. Part 1 of this study will 
evaluate the safety and efficacy of 2 dose levels of BIIB091 
monotherapy compared to the standard-dose DRF (462 mg twice 
daily [BID]). Part 2 of this study will evaluate the safety and 
efficacy of the selected BIIB091 dose in combination with either 
the standard dose (462 mg BID) or a lower dose (350 mg BID) of 
DRF, and both combination therapies will be compared to the 
standard-dose DRF.
Rationale for Dose and 
Schedule Selection:Dose Recommendation
In both Part 1 and Part 2, BIIB091 will be dosed with the 
immediate-release (IR) tablet formulation BID via oral 
administration after regular meals (within 30 to 60 minutes after 
meals) for a total of 48 weeks. BIIB091 should not be taken in 
the fasted state. In Part 1, BIIB091 350 mg BID and 250 mg BID 
will be used as the high dose and low dose, respectively. In Part 
2, the BIIB091 dose will be selected based on benefit-risk 
evaluation of Part 1 data.
DRF will be supplied as capsules consisting of enteric-coated, 
pH-sensitive DRF minitablets. In both Part 1 and Part 2, 
participants treated with the standard-dose DRF will take the 
starting dose of 231 mg BID for the first 7 days and then 462 mg 
BID thereafter. In Part 2, participants receiving the BIIB091 and 
low-dose DRF combination therapy will take DRF 231 mg BID 
for the first 7 days and then 350 mg BID thereafter. 
Rationale for targeting a high level of BTK inhibition with 
BIIB091 
The Phase 2 clinical trial of tolebrutinib (a covalent, irreversible 
BTK inhibitor) showed that only the highest dose (60 mg once 
daily [QD]) significantly reduced T1 gadolinium-enhancing 
(GdE) lesions at 12 weeks in participants with RMS [ Reich 
2021]. In a Phase 1 trial, the 60-mg QD dose demonstrated 
approximately 93% of mean target occupancy in the periphery 
[Owens 2022]. Similarly, a Phase 2 study of evobrutinib (another Protocol 257MS201, Version 2.0

14covalent, irreversible BTK inhibitor) showed that the largest and 
most sustained reduction in annualized relapse rate (ARR) was 
achieved at the highest dose of 75 mg BID, when over 95% of 
BTK target occupancy was achieved in the periphery in about 
98% of treated patients [ Montalban 2019]. These data suggest 
that a high level of BTK inhibition in the periphery is required to 
achieve sufficient efficacy in reducing disease activity in MS.
Rationale for BIIB091 Doses
It is hypothesized that as a noncovalent inhibitor of BTK, 
BIIB091 treatment will provide clinical benefit in patients with 
MS as a group mainly through selectively and reversibly 
targeting BTK-related functions in B cells. Examination of the 
cluster of differentiation (CD)69 expression level on B cells after 
ex vivo BCR-mediated activation allows for the assessment of 
the inhibitory effect of circulating BIIB091 [ Bame 2021]. In the 
multiple ascending dose (MAD) part of the first-in-human Phase 
1 Study 257HV101, administration of 150 mg BID or 300 mg 
BID of BIIB091 for 14 days demonstrated > 90% mean 
inhibition of CD69 expression, which was maintained from Day 
2 through Day 14 dosing intervals. Serum levels of BIIB091 at 
trough concentration (C trough) appeared to be associated with the 
magnitude of CD69 inhibition and PK/pharmacodynamic (PD) 
modeling predicted an observed curve-fit EC90 corresponding to 
approximately 221 ng/mL. Therefore, a C trough of 221 ng/mL had 
been set as the lower limit of exposure to maintain a high degree 
of CD69 inhibition.
Analysis of the clinical data from the Study 257HV101 indicated 
that QT prolongation is an identified risk with BIIB091. The QT 
prolongation was dose dependent (observed only at higher 
exposure levels) and was driven primarily by maximum 
concentration (C max). Based on the concentration-QT interval 
corrected for heart rate (QTc) analysis in the single ascending 
dose (SAD) part of the study, for which the model provided the 
best fit at high concentrations, a mean placebo-corrected change-
from-baseline Fridericia corrected QT interval (QTcF) [i.e., 
placebo-corrected QTcF] exceeding 15 ms can be avoided by 
keeping the C max under approximately 4018 ng/mL. Therefore, a 
mean C max of less than 4018 ng/mL had been set as the upper 
limit of exposure based on concentration-QTc analysis. 
Part 1B data from the Phase 1 formulation PK study, Study 
257HV105, demonstrated that the administration of the BIIB091 
IR tablet formulation at 250 mg twice on Day 1 (12 hours apart) Protocol 257MS201, Version 2.0

15in the fasted state and at 350 mg twice on Day 1 (12 hours apart) 
under the fed state resulted in a mean C max < 4018 ng/mL and a 
mean C trough > 221 ng/mL. In addition, simulated data at steady 
state from the population PK (popPK) model based on Study 
257HV101 and Part 1B of Study 257HV105 supported a dose 
range of 200 to 350 mg with BID dosing based on achieving the 
above thresholds. The BIIB091 350 mg dose, when administered 
as a single dose and in a 2-dose regimen in Part 1B of Study 
257HV105, was well tolerated and may potentially achieve 
> 90% of CD69 inhibition in B cells in > 90% of treated 
participants at steady state. 
Study 257HV105 Part 3 evaluated the PK, PD, and safety of a 
7-day treatment with BIIB091 IR 250 mg BID under the fed state 
in 10 evaluable participants. Based on available data from the 
10 participants, the BIIB091 250 mg BID dose showed a 
favorable safety and tolerability profile. The mean C max and 
concentration at dosing time plus dosing interval (C tau) were 
2500 ng/mL and 407 ng/mL on Day 7 (steady state), 
respectively. Mean C tau at steady state was above 221 ng/mL in 9 
of these 10 treated participants. 
To elucidate the exposure-response relationship, 2 BIIB091 
doses were selected for Part 1 of this Phase 2 study. The 
proposed BIIB091 high dose (350 mg BID) and low dose 
(250 mg BID) were selected to target a high level of BTK 
inhibition (represented by > 90% CD69 inhibition) in > 90% and 
80% to 90% of participants, respectively. Both doses are 
expected to have favorable safety and tolerability profiles. Data 
from Part 1 of the Phase 2 study will be used to select the 
BIIB091 dose with the optimal benefit-risk profile for Part 2. The 
selected BIIB091 dose for Part 2 could be different from the 
Part 1 doses (e.g., 300 mg BID).
Rationale for DRF Doses
The standard dose of DRF in the Phase 2 study will follow the 
approved DRF dose regimen. 
In the context of BIIB091 and DRF combination therapy, it is 
hypothesized that a lower dose of DRF could potentially reduce 
some of the possible side effects associated with combination 
therapy while maintaining a high level of efficacy. Di-ester 
fumarate therapy mainly modulates T-cell immunity. Given 
inhibition of B-cell-mediated antigen presentation to T cells 
following BIIB091 treatment, the degree of direct T-cell Protocol 257MS201, Version 2.0

16immunomodulation required to achieve maximal efficacy within 
MS patients may be reduced. This could potentially allow for a 
lower than standard dose of DRF when dosed in combination 
with BIIB091.
DRF is an aminoethyl ester of MMF that undergoes presystemic 
hydrolysis through esterases to produce MMF. MMF is also the 
active metabolite of the approved drug product DMF (dimethyl 
fumarate; Tecfidera). Both DRF and DMF produce their 
therapeutic effects primarily by the active metabolite MMF. PK 
assessment has demonstrated the exposure of MMF after oral 
administration of 462 mg DRF and 240 mg DMF in adults is 
bioequivalent.
Studies C-1900, 109MS301, and 109MS302 have demonstrated 
that DMF 240 mg BID (480 mg daily) and 240 mg 3 times daily 
(TID) [720 mg daily] doses had comparable levels of efficacy, 
whereas the 120 mg TID dose (360 mg daily, i.e., 75% of the 
approved dose) demonstrated a reduction in the number of T1 
GdE lesions from Baseline, although not statistically significant. 
Therefore, the lower dose of DRF is selected at 350 mg BID, 
corresponding to approximately 75% of the standard DRF daily 
dose.

Exploratory objectives and endpoints (Part 1 and Part 2) are listed in Section 4. 
Study Design: This is a 2-part, multicenter, randomized, blinded, 
active-controlled Phase 2 study to sequentially evaluate the 
safety and efficacy of BIIB091 monotherapy and BIIB091 
combination therapy with DRF in participants with RMS.
The study will be conducted in 2 parts. Both Part 1 and Part 2 
each include a 4-week screening period, a 16-week double-blind 
active-controlled treatment period, a 32-week blinded 
active-controlled treatment period, and a 2-week post-treatment 
safety follow-up period. Participants with absolute lymphocyte 
count (ALC) < lower limit of normal (LLN) at the 2-week safety 
Follow-Up Visit will return in 2 weeks for retesting and 
confirmation, and follow-up will be extended for those 
participants at intervals of every 8 weeks to monitor their 
lymphocyte counts until their ALC > LLN, or for a period up to 
6 months, or until they commence another disease-modifying 
therapy, whichever occurs first.
In Part 1, participants with active RMS will be randomized to 
3 treatment groups: high-dose BIIB091 monotherapy (350 mg 
BID), low-dose BIIB091 monotherapy (250 mg BID), and DRF 
monotherapy at standard dose (462 mg BID). An analysis of the 
Part 1 primary, secondary, and selected exploratory endpoints 
will be performed after all participants complete the 16-week 
visit. An independent data monitoring committee (IDMC) will 
review the safety and lab data from the Part 1 Week 16 analysis 
to recommend whether Part 2 should be initiated (see 
Section 12.8 and Section 14.3.2 for details). In the event of 
unfavorable safety findings, the IDMC could recommend 
pausing or stopping a cohort or the study or a modification to the 
study design. Details regarding the IDMC review of data will be 
provided in the IDMC charter. Selected Sponsor team members 
will be unblinded to participate in the primary analysis of Part 1 
data at Week 16, to determine whether to proceed to Part 2 based 
on the overall benefit-risk profile and to select the BIIB091 dose 
to be used in Part 2.Protocol 257MS201, Version 2.0

19In Part 2, participants with RMS will be randomized to 
3 treatment groups: the selected BIIB091 dose in combination 
with standard dose (462 mg BID) of DRF, the selected BIIB091 
dose in combination with lower dose (350 mg BID) of DRF, and 
DRF monotherapy at standard dose (462 mg BID). The primary 
analysis comparing the BIIB091/DRF combination therapy to 
DRF monotherapy will be performed after all participants 
complete the Week 16 visit in Part 2. 
Final analysis of the 48-week data from Part 1 and Part 2 will 
allow for the assessment of longer-term safety and efficacy of 
BIIB091 monotherapy and BIIB091 combination therapy with 
DRF. For maintenance of blinding, members of the study 
management team who are not involved in the Week 16 data 
review (in Part 1 and Part 2) and the study sites will remain 
blinded for the entire duration of the study (Section 7.4). Details 
on how the study blind is maintained will be provided in a 
separate unblinding plan.
For both Part 1 and Part 2, participants will visit the study site for 
safety, MRI, and clinical efficacy assessments at Day -28 to 
Day 1 (MRI assessments should be completed at least 
7 calendar days and no more than 14 calendar days prior to 
Baseline [Day 1]), and Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, and 48. Additional 
specific safety assessments will be performed at Weeks 1, 2, 6, 
36, and 50. The primary efficacy endpoint in Part 2 will be the 
cumulative number of new T1 GdE lesions at Weeks 8, 12, and 
16 (Section 4). 
During Part1 or Part 2 of the study, if an MS relapse is suspected, 
the participant should return to the study site for an unscheduled 
visit and be evaluated within 72 hours of the onset of the event to 
determine if a relapse has occurred. Treatment of an acute 
relapse event may proceed at the discretion of the treating 
neurologist only after the examining neurologist has completed 
their examination. The treatment for relapse in this study is 
intravenous methylprednisolone (IVMP)  1000 mg/day for up 
to a maximum of 5 days with or without an oral prednisone taper 
(up to 15 days). Any changes to this treatment should first be 
discussed with the Study Medical Director or designee. If the 
start of a treatment for a relapse with high-dose corticosteroids 
falls within 7 days of the next scheduled visit, every attempt 
should be made to obtain the MRI before administration of the 
first dose of high-dose corticosteroids. If outside the visit 
window, visit should be recorded as unscheduled. The MRI at an Protocol 257MS201, Version 2.0

20unscheduled visit prior to steroid treatment must be  21 days 
after the prior MRI. However, if an MRI at an unscheduled visit 
is < 21 days after a prior MRI, then the use of gadolinium (Gd)-
based contrast agents/media should be strongly avoided, unless 
determined by the Investigator to be clinically indicated. In this 
scenario, the next regularly scheduled MRI should also be 
obtained.
Study Location: Approximately 80 sites globally are planned.
Study Population: This study will be conducted in participants who meet the 
following criteria:
Aged 18 through 55 years old, inclusive, at the time 
of informed consent
Time since MS symptom onset < 20 years
Diagnosed with MS per the 2010 or 2017 
McDonalds criteria [ Polman 2011; Thompson 2018]
Must have Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) 
score of 0 through 5.0 at Screening
Must have at least 1 of the following occurring prior 
to Baseline (Day 1):
 2 clinical relapses in the last 24 months (but not 
within 30 days prior to Baseline [Day 1]) with at 
least 1 relapse during the last 12 months prior to 
randomization
 1 clinical relapse within the past 24 months (but 
not within 30 days prior to Baseline [Day 1]) and 
 1 new brain MRI lesion (Gd-positive and/or

22administered to maintain blinding of the treatment group 
assignments by disguising both the type of study drug and dose 
level administered (see Section 7.3 for details).
Sample Size 
Determination:The planned sample size is 275 participants. 
Accounting for a 12% dropout rate, 275 participants are planned 
to be enrolled in the study. Of these, 125 participants will be 
randomized in Part 1 and 150 will be randomized in Part 2. 
In Part 2, a sample size of 50 participants per group 
(44 evaluable) was designed to detect an 80% reduction from the 
mean number (standard deviation) of 1.2 (3) cumulative new 
T1 GdE lesions over MRI scans at Weeks 8, 12, and 16 in the 
standard dose of DRF monotherapy with approximately 90% 
power and a 10% Type 1 error rate. 
A sample size of 50 participants (44 evaluable) per treatment 
group will allow for an 80% or greater probability of observing 
at least 1 occurrence of an AE with an event rate of 3.6%.
In Part 1, intensive PK will be collected in up to 25 participants 
(approximately 10 participants in each BIIB091 group and 
approximately 5 participants in the DRF group).
In Part 2, intensive PK will be collected in up to 30 participants 
(approximately 10 participants in each group).
Visit Schedule: Participants will have up to 12 scheduled visits during the study. 
Study assessments conducted at each visit are listed in the 
Schedule of Activities ( Table 1).
Participants in Part 1 of the study cannot participate in Part 2 of 
the study. Visit days are calculated with respect to Day 1 (the 
date of first dose). 
Duration of Study 
Participation:The study duration for participants in either Part 1 or Part 2 will 
be approximately 54 weeks and includes the following:
4-week screening period
16-week double-blind, active-controlled treatment

treatment purposes.Konectom is not intended for or being 
developed as a standalone or adjunctive diagnostic device. 
Konectom does not provide any recommendations or conclusions 
related to diagnosis or treatment.
Benefit-Risk Analysis: BIIB091 is hypothesized to provide clinical benefits in patients 
with MS as a group mainly through selectively and reversibly 
targeting BTK-related functions in B cells and myeloid cells. 
QTc prolongation is an identified risk for BIIB091 (see the 
BIIB091 Investigators Brochure [IB] for details). This Phase 2 
study will continue to follow risk mitigation measures for 
QT/QTc prolongation, which will include intensive 12-lead 
triplicate ECGs during the first month of dosing in all 
participants. Additional risk mitigations for the QT/QTc 
prolongation will be reflected in the inclusion and exclusion 
criteria, discontinuation criteria, and when applicable, study 
stopping criteria. Furthermore, based on its mode of action 
(MOA), there is a theoretical increased risk of infections. 
General risk mitigation for infections will also be implemented. 
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-specific risk mitigations 
will also be implemented in accordance with the Sponsors 
monitoring and prevention control measures for severe acute 
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and 
will be amended based on emerging local, regional, and national 
guidance. Additionally, as hemorrhage and bleeding have been 
described as class side effects for earlier generation BTK 
inhibitors [ von Hundelshausen and Siess 2021], the monitoring 
for potential BIIB091 effects on platelet function will be 
implemented in this study. 
DRF, under the trade name Vumerity, has been approved by the 
United States (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the 
treatment of adults with RMS and in the European Union (EU) 
for the treatment of relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) 
[VUMERITY USPI 2022; Vumerity SmPC 2022], and 
subsequently approved in several countries. In participants with 
RRMS, DRF demonstrated safety and tolerability in 2 global 
Phase 3 studies (see the DRF IB for details). Risk mitigation for 
DRF in this study will include monitoring for ALC, leucocyte 
counts, liver function, and opportunistic and other infections. Protocol 257MS201, Version 2.0

24Additional risk mitigations specific for DRF will be reflected in 
the inclusion and exclusion criteria, discontinuation criteria, and 
when applicable, study stopping criteria. 
The combination therapy of BIIB091 and DRF is expected to 
provide a convenient oral option with an expected transformative 
efficacy and a favorable safety and tolerability profile. Although 
BIIB091 has a risk of QTc prolongation, a QTcF study of DRF 
did not show a clinically meaningful effect on QTc interval and 
no compounding effect is expected for the combination. 
Lymphopenia may be observed with DRF, mostly impacting 
CD4 and CD8 T cells with an initial decline and stabilization by 
approximately 24 weeks. While BIIB091 exerts its effects on B 
cells, it is not a B-cell-depleting agent and therefore, BIIB091 is 
not expected to cause additive lymphopenia. Additionally, DRF 
may cause elevation in hepatic transaminases as anticipated from 
the DMF data where the active metabolite is the same as DRF 
(most were  3  upper limit of normal in clinical studies, and 
these abnormalities resolve upon DMF discontinuation). To date, 
BIIB091 has no evidence of increased risk of elevation in liver 
enzymes based on the limited available clinical data, but 
acknowledging that other BTK inhibitors in late phases of 
development have reported hepatic events, a more conservative 
approach is applied here. The monitoring plan for liver enzymes 
is detailed in Section 8.1.
There is a theoretical risk for increased infections with the 
combination treatment despite having a minimally overlapping 
MOA. Enhanced risk mitigations for infections will be 
implemented in this study with close monitoring of ALC, 
leukocyte count, immunoglobulin (Ig) levels, and more stringent 
inclusion and exclusion criteria and discontinuation criteria.
As with many clinical studies, there is some burden for 
participants. This clinical study includes 12 scheduled study 
visits, up to 14 blood sample collections, 8 scheduled MRI tests, 
physical discomfort from participation, and time spent on 
completing assessment questionnaires. Despite that, participants 
in this study are expected to benefit from intensive monitoring 
and management of their disease. Moreover, all participants will 
be receiving a form of active drug (either BIIB091, DRF, or 
both) that is expected to have a positive impact on their disease.Protocol 257MS201, Version 2.0

25For treatment with either BIIB091 or DRF or the combination, an

regarding the study conduct (Section 14.3.2).
Considering the minimally overlapping MOA, toxicology 
combination therapy data, outlined risk mitigation strategies, and 
the need for a highly efficacious oral therapies in MS, testing the 
combination of BIIB091 with DRF in this Phase 2 study would 
provide a favorable benefit-risk profile. Protocol 257MS201, Version 2.0

1The Baseline Visit assessments can be split over 2 consecutive days and must be completed prior to the administration of the first dose on Day 1.
2The Part 1 and Part 2 treatment periods are double blinded up to the Week 16 Visit. 
3After Week 16, the participants, the sites, and the study management team members who are not involved in the Week 16 data analysis, will continue to be 
blinded through Week 48.
4Unscheduled visits are to be determined at the discretion of the treating neurologist if no relapse is suspected. Participants are to return to the study site for a 
separate relapse assessment evaluation (see Section 5.3) to be performed within 72 hours of the onset of any new or worsening neurologic symptom(s). 
Participants in the Czech Republic must begin treatment for an acute relapse within 5 days of symptom onset, even if the MRI scan has not yet been performed. 
EDSS should only be assessed at an unscheduled visit if relapse is suspected. Hematology, blood chemistry, and urinalysis will be performed only at the 
discretion of the treating physician if infection or metabolic disturbance is suspected to be contributing to the unscheduled visit. See footnote 22 for MRI at 
unscheduled visit for relapse.
5Participants who discontinue study treatment early are encouraged to remain in the study and continue protocol-required tests and assessments through the EOS 
and Follow-Up Visits and would not complete an ET Visit. Participants who withdraw from the study should complete the ET Visit at the time of withdrawal 
and are also encouraged to complete the blinded post-treatment Follow-Up Visit unless withdrawal is due to death or withdrawal of consent. Protocol 257MS201, Version 2.0

336 Tests and assessments must be completed prior to dispensing study treatment to participants. It is not required that all screening tests and assessments be 
completed during a single visit.
7All inclusion/exclusion criteria should be assessed at the Screening Visit and confirmed prior to the first dose of study treatment.
8HIV testing will be performed at the Screening Visit unless prohibited by local regulations.
9For women suspected not to be of childbearing potential. Results must be known prior to enrollment.
10For WOCBP. Results must be known prior to enrollment.
11SARS-CoV-2 PCR test must be performed at the Screening Visit and repeated if the Screening Visit occurs > 2 weeks prior to Baseline (Day 1). Further testing 
during the study is permitted at the discretion of the Investigator. Testing may be conducted by the central laboratory selected by the Sponsor or locally 
(Appendix 1).
12If the test performed at the Screening Visit is within 7 days of Baseline (Day 1), the assessment does not need to be repeated at Baseline (Day 1).
13Participants will have their body temperature, pulse rate, respiratory rate, and diastolic and systolic blood pressure measured. Participants must remain in the 
same sitting position for 5 minutes prior to having their pulse rate and blood pressure taken.
14ECG should be recorded after the participant has been supine for at least 5 minutes. Triplicate ECGs will be recorded at the 2- and 5-hour intensive PK 
sampling timepoints (Week 4 Visit).
15Participants with ALC < LLN at the 2-week safety Follow-Up Visit will return in 2 weeks for retesting and confirmation, and follow-up will be extended for 
those participants at intervals of 8 weeks to monitor their lymphocyte counts until their ALC > LLN, or for a period up to 6 months, or until they commence 
another disease-modifying therapy, whichever occurs first. Laboratory safety assessments will be conducted at the central laboratory. The platelet function test 
may be conducted at the central laboratory or local laboratory, as applicable. All sites are required to conduct the platelet function test if they have the 
capability to perform it on site or at an external laboratory.
16These tests are only for participants who will have received pneumococcal or tetanus vaccine within 5 years or influenza vaccine within 1 year of study 
participation.
17The Baseline screening C-SSRS version will be used at Screening, and the Since Last Visit C-SSRS version will be used for subsequent visits. 
18Samples for all PK/PD assessments will need to be collected before study treatment administration on the day of the visit unless otherwise noted.
19Intensive PK sampling in a subset of participants (see Section 12.9) will be conducted at Week 4 Visit. The PK sampling timepoints for BIIB091, MMF, and 
HES are -15 minutes (predose) and 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 hours (postdose; relative to time 0 [the first dose administered]) on that day (see Table 2).
20Where local regulations and ethics committee approval allows, an optional blood DNA sample will be collected for unspecified future exploratory genetic 
research. Participants who opt for this one-time optional DNA sample collection will be required to sign an optional Genetic Research ICF. 
21PRO questionnaires (i.e., PROMIS-29 profile and FSMC) must be completed under the supervision of the primary treating nurse or study coordinator during 
clinical visits before objective test performance is tested. Refer to the Study Reference Guide for additional instructions.
22MRI assessments should be completed at least 7 calendar days and no more than 14 calendar days prior to Baseline (Day 1) before dosing; subsequent scans 
will be performed on Weeks 4 ( 3 days), 8 ( 3 days), 12 ( 3 days), 16 ( 3 days), 24 ( 5 days), and 48 ( 5 days). IV corticosteroid treatment and oral 
corticosteroid treatment must be discontinued 4 weeks prior to and during the Screening period. Brain MRI scans will be performed according to a standardized 
imaging protocol before and after the administration of single-dose Gd. If the start of a treatment for a relapse with high-dose corticosteroids falls within 7 days 
of the next scheduled visit, every attempt should be made to obtain the MRI before administration of the first dose of high-dose corticosteroids. If outside the 
visit window, visit should be recorded as unscheduled. The MRI at an unscheduled visit prior to steroid treatment must be  21 days after the prior MRI. 
However, if an MRI at an unscheduled visit is < 21 days after a prior MRI, then the use of Gd should be strongly avoided, unless determined by the Investigator 
to be clinically indicated. In this scenario, the next regularly scheduled MRI should also be obtained. 
23MRI at ET Visit will only be performed if an MRI was not performed within 3 weeks prior to termination.Protocol 257MS201, Version 2.0

3424The Screening EDSS will be considered when determining participant eligibility.
25Participants should perform 2 separate practice tests for T25FW, 9HPT-D, and 9HPT-ND at their Screening Visit, separated by at least 5 minutes. These data 
will be recorded. Following the 2 practice tests, participants should complete each test again, separated by at least 5 minutes; the latter data will be recorded as 
a result of the Screening Visit. If the tests performed at Screening are within 7 days of Baseline (Day 1), they do not need to be repeated at Baseline (Day 1). 
Only the official test scores are entered into EDC. 
26For in-clinic Konectom assessments, the 6MWT and MSIS-29 v2 assessments only need to be at Baseline (Day 1) and Weeks 8, 16, 24, 36, and 48. 
27At-home tests will be requested daily for the first-week post-Baseline (Day 1) and weekly for the remainder of the trial. At-home tests will not be requested for 
weeks with in-clinic Konectom administration.
28For all participants in the study, the time and date of the first dose of treatment must be recorded by site staff in the eCRF. For participants in the intensive PK 
subset, the time and date of the dose during the Week 4 visit must be recorded by site staff in the eCRF.Protocol 257MS201, Version 2.0

413. INTRODUCTION 
3.1. Study Rationale
Currently, there are multiple approved treatments for RMS. However, there remains a significant 
unmet need in safety, tolerability, convenience, and efficacy of current therapies for MS (see 
Section 3.2.1 and Section 3.2.2).
BIIB091 is an orally administered, potent, selective, noncovalent (reversible), and peripherally 
restricted small-molecule inhibitor of BTK, a tyrosine-protein kinase that is a key signaling node 
immediately downstream of the BCR and FcR engagement. Because it is a reversible inhibitor of 
BTK, BIIB091 may couple robust efficacy in quieting circulating inflammatory cells with the 
ability to restore immune functions rapidly after discontinuation when vaccination or 
management of AEs is needed. The population for this study includes adult participants with 
RMS. 
Unlike irreversible BTK inhibitors that are reliant on BTK half-life to sustain target occupancy 
over a dosing interval, based on current nonclinical data, the main and desired pharmacologic 
activity of BIIB091 is expected to depend primarily on and correlate with circulating levels of 
the compound. The half-life of BIIB091 in humans is relatively short (based on data from the 
first-in-human Study 257HV101 and Study 257HV105 Part 1B, median t  ranged from 6 to 
16 hours across all dose levels), with QD or more frequent dosing required to maintain inhibition 
of BTK function and subsequent inhibition of B-cell activation, as measured by upregulation of 
surface expression of CD69. CD69 was chosen as a biomarker of B-cell activation because the 
upregulation of the CD69 membrane protein is BTK-dependent and correlates with the induction 
of other proteins upon BCR-mediated B-cell activation. It is expected that inhibition of BTK will 
also result in inhibition of FcR-mediated myeloid-cell activation, which can be assessed in 
basophils by surface expression of CD63. 
DRF (BIIB098) was developed as a delayed-release, gastro-resistant oral treatment for RMS. 
DRF, under the trade name Vumerity, has been approved by the US FDA for the treatment of 
adults with RMS and in the EU for the treatment of RRMS [ VUMERITY USPI 2022; 
Vumerity SmPC 2022]. DRF is an aminoethyl ester of MMF. In the GI tract, DRF undergoes 
rapid and complete presystemic hydrolysis through esterases to produce MMF. DRF produces its 
therapeutic effects primarily by the active metabolite MMF [ Werdenberg 2003]. MMF is further 
metabolized through the tricarboxylic acid cycle, with the exhalation of carbon dioxide as the 
primary route of elimination, accounting for approximately 60% of the dose. In participants with 
RRMS, DRF demonstrated safety and tolerability in 2 completed global Phase 3 studies: 
Study ALK8700-A301 (EVOLVE-MS-1) and Study ALK8700-A302 (EVOLVE-MS-2). In both 
studies, DRF at a dose of 231 mg BID for 1 week followed by 462 mg BID for 96 weeks (in 
EVOLVE-MS-1) and at a dose of 462 mg BID for 4 weeks (in EVOLVE-MS-2) had an 
acceptable safety profile and was well tolerated (see the DRF IB).
The combination of the inhibition of B-cell and myeloid-cell activation with BIIB091 and the 
modulation of the proinflammatory properties of T cells and myeloid cells with DRF could have 
an additive or synergistic effect and result in transformative efficacy in minimizing the Protocol 257MS201, Version 2.0

42underlying inflammation that drives cumulative disability. In addition, this combination therapy 
is expected to have minimal overlapping adverse effects based on clinical monotherapy data and 
nonclinical data from the 90-day combination toxicology study. The combination therapy is also 
expected to have minimal potential for drug-drug PK interactions. 
To characterize the clinical safety and efficacy profile of BIIB091 monotherapy in patients with 
MS prior to assessment of BIIB091 and DRF combination therapy, this adaptive study design 
consists of 2 sequential parts. Part 1 of this study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of 2 dose 
levels of BIIB091 monotherapy compared to the standard-dose DRF. Part 2 of this study will 
evaluate the safety and efficacy of the selected BIIB091 dose in combination with either the 
standard dose (462 mg BID) or a lower dose (350 mg BID) of DRF, and both combination 
therapies will be compared to the standard-dose DRF ( Figure 1).
3.1.1. Rationale for Study Population
The overall objective of this study is to evaluate the potential efficacy and safety of BIIB091 
alone and in combination with DRF in participants with relapsing forms of MS between the ages 
of 18 and 55 years. People with relapsing forms of MS make up the majority of MS patients. The 
specific population for this study is representative of the demographics of relapsing forms of MS 
by clinical and imaging criteria, as well as by age. Based on the studys inclusion and exclusion 
criteria, it is anticipated none or only a few participants would be incapable of giving informed 
consent and this study excludes minors. 
Clinical data demonstrating the benefit of inhibition of the BTK pathway in patients with RMS 
are starting to emerge in the literature. Results from a recent Phase 2 clinical trial of the covalent 
(irreversible) BTK inhibitor evobrutinib in RMS demonstrated significantly fewer T1 GdE 
lesions during Weeks 12 through Weeks 24 in the evobrutinib 75 mg QD group compared to 
placebo [ Montalban 2019]. Additionally, a Phase 2 clinical trial of the covalent (irreversible) 
BTK inhibitor tolebrutinib (SAR442168) in patients with RMS demonstrated a significant 
reduction in the number of new T1 GdE and new or enlarging T2 hyperintense lesions at 12 
weeks in the tolebrutinib 60 mg QD group compared to placebo [ Reich 2021]. 
3.1.2. Rationale for Dosing Regimen
3.1.2.1. Rationale for BIIB091 Doses
The Phase 2 clinical trial of tolebrutinib (a covalent, irreversible BTK inhibitor) showed that 
only the highest dose (60 mg QD) significantly reduced T1 GdE lesions at 12 weeks in 
participants with RMS [ Reich 2021]. In a Phase 1 trial, the 60 mg QD dose demonstrated 
approximately 93% of mean target occupancy in the periphery [ Owens 2022]. Similarly, a 
Phase 2 study of evobrutinib (another covalent, irreversible BTK inhibitor) showed that the 
largest and most sustained reduction in ARR was achieved at the highest dose of 75 mg BID 
when over 95% of BTK target occupancy was achieved in the periphery in about 98% of treated 
patients [ Montalban 2019]. These data suggest that a high level of BTK inhibition in the 
periphery is required to achieve sufficient efficacy in reducing disease activity in MS.Protocol 257MS201, Version 2.0

43As a noncovalent inhibitor of BTK, it is hypothesized that BIIB091 treatment will provide 
clinical benefit in patients with MS as a group mainly through selectively and reversibly 
targeting BTK-related functions in B cells. Examination of the CD69 expression level on B cells 
after ex vivo BCR-mediated activation allows for the assessment of the inhibitory effect of 
circulating BIIB091 [ Bame 2021]. In the MAD part of the first-in-human Phase 1 Study 
257HV101, administration of 150 mg BID or 300 mg BID of BIIB091 for 14 days demonstrated 
> 90% mean inhibition of CD69 expression, which was maintained from Day 2 through Day 14 
dosing intervals. Serum levels of BIIB091 at C trough appeared to be associated with the extent of 
CD69 inhibition, and PK/PD modeling predicted an observed curve-fit EC 90 corresponding to 
approximately 221 ng/mL. Therefore, a C trough of 221 ng/mL had been set as the lower limit of 
exposure to maintain a high degree of CD69 inhibition.
Analysis of the clinical data from Study 257HV101 indicated that QT prolongation is an 
identified risk with BIIB091. The QT prolongation effect was dose dependent (observed only at 
higher exposure levels) and was driven primarily by C max. Based on the concentration-QTc 
analysis in the SAD part of the study, for which the model provided the best fit at high 
concentrations, a mean QTcF (i.e., placebo-corrected QTcF) exceeding 15 ms can be 
avoided by keeping the C max under approximately 4018 ng/mL. Therefore, a mean C max of less 
than 4018 ng/mL had been set as the upper limit of exposure based on concentration-QTc 
analysis. 
Part 1B data from the Phase 1 formulation PK study, Study 257HV105, demonstrated that the 
administration of the BIIB091 IR tablet formulation at 250 mg twice on Day 1 (12 hours apart) 
in the fasted state and at 350 mg twice on Day 1 (12 hours apart) under the fed state resulted in a 
mean C max < 4018 ng/mL and a mean C trough > 221 ng/mL. In addition, simulated data at steady 
state from the popPK model based on Study 257HV101 and Part 1B of Study 257HV105 
supported a dose range of 200 to 350 mg with BID dosing based on achieving the above 
thresholds. The BIIB091 350 mg dose, when administered as a single dose and in a 2-dose 
regimen in Part 1B of Study 257HV105, was well tolerated and may potentially achieve over 
> 90% of CD69 inhibition in B cells in > 90% of treated participants at steady state. 
Study 257HV105 Part 3 evaluated the PK, PD, and safety of a 7-day treatment with BIIB091 IR 
250 mg BID under the fed state in 10 evaluable participants. Based on available data from the 
10 participants, the BIIB091 250 mg BID dose showed a favorable safety and tolerability profile. 
The mean C max and C tau were 2500 ng/mL and 407 ng/mL on Day 7 (steady state), respectively. 
Mean C tau at steady state was above 221 ng/mL in 9 of the 10 treated participants.
To elucidate the exposure-response relationship, 2 BIIB091 doses were selected for Part 1 of this 
Phase 2 study. The proposed BIIB091 high dose (350 mg BID) and low dose (250 mg BID) were 
selected to target a high level of BTK inhibition (represented by > 90% CD69 inhibition) in 
> 90% and 80% to 90% of participants, respectively. Both doses are expected to have favorable 
safety and tolerability profiles. Data from Part 1 of the Phase 2 study will be used to select the 
BIIB091 dose with the optimal benefit-risk profile for Part 2. The selected BIIB091 dose for 
Part 2 could be different from the Part 1 doses (e.g., 300 mg BID).Protocol 257MS201, Version 2.0

443.1.2.2. Rationale for Diroximel Fumarate Doses
The standard dose of DRF in the Phase 2 study will follow the approved DRF dose regimen. 
In the context of BIIB091 and DRF combination therapy, it is hypothesized that a lower dose of 
DRF could potentially reduce some of the possible side effects associated with combination 
therapy while maintaining a high level of efficacy. Di-ester fumarate therapy mainly modulates 
T-cell immunity. Given inhibition of B-cell-mediated antigen presentation to T cells following 
BIIB091 treatment, the degree of direct T-cell immunomodulation required to achieve maximal 
efficacy within MS patients may be reduced. This could potentially allow for a lower than 
standard dose of DRF when dosed in combination with BIIB091.
DRF is an aminoethyl ester of MMF that undergoes presystemic hydrolysis through esterases to 
produce MMF. MMF is also the active metabolite of the approved drug product DMF 
(Tecfidera). Both DRF and DMF produce their therapeutic effects primarily by the active 
metabolite MMF. PK assessment has demonstrated the exposure of MMF after oral 
administration of 462 mg DRF and 240 mg DMF in adults is bioequivalent.
Studies C-1900, 109MS301, and 109MS302 have demonstrated that DMF 240 mg BID (480 mg 
daily) and 240 mg TID (720 mg daily) doses had comparable levels of efficacy, whereas the 
120 mg TID dose (360 mg daily, i.e., 75% of the approved dose) demonstrated a reduction in the 
number of T1 GdE lesions from Baseline, although not statistically significant. Therefore, the 
lower dose of DRF is selected at 350 mg BID, corresponding to approximately 75% of the 
standard DRF daily dose.
3.1.3. Rationale for the Use of Authorized and/or Unauthorized Auxiliary Medicinal 
Products
This study uses the auxiliary medicinal products Gd-based contrast agents/media (ATC code: 
V08CA) and IVMP.
The assessment of GdE lesion endpoints require that MRIs be conducted before and after 
administration of Gd-based contrast agents/media. Gd-based contrast agents/media must have a 
marketing authorization. Sites will use the Gd-based contrast agents/media currently approved in 
the local country, according to the SmPC/USPI/local label, as applicable.
IVMP is authorized for the treatment of MS relapse in the US [ SOLU-MEDROL USPI 2021] 
and other countries, and is an accepted standard of care in the EU [ EMA 
(EMA/CHMP/771815/2011 Rev. 2) 2015] and other regions. IVMP is typically given as high 
dose (i.e., 1000 mg/day) over a period of 3 to 5 days and may be followed by an oral taper. Thus, 
IVMP of 1000 mg/day up to a total of 5 days and with or without an oral taper was chosen in this 
study protocol.

453.2. Background
3.2.1. Overview of Multiple Sclerosis
MS is a chronic, autoimmune, demyelinating disorder of the CNS characterized by 
inflammation, demyelination, and axonal injury as well as oligodendrocyte and neuronal loss. 
It is the most common demyelinating disorder of the CNS, affecting approximately 2.5 million 
people worldwide and typically diagnosed in young to middle-aged adults. While there has been 
substantial progress in MS care over the last 25 years, many people with MS continue to 
experience disease activity and disability progression that culminates in permanent impairment 
and loss of independence in performing activities of daily living. Additionally, many currently 
approved therapies are associated with burdensome monitoring or risk of SAEs. Therefore, there 
remains an unmet need for tolerable MS therapies that, when initiated early in the disease, 
minimize the underlying inflammation that drives the disease and its cumulative contribution to 
disability, yet have an acceptable safety profile with low or no risk of opportunistic infection or 
secondary autoimmunity.
The pathological changes underlying MS are believed to be mediated by activated circulating 
lymphocytes, which cross the blood-brain barrier and initiate an immune-mediated cascade of 
events that injures both the grey and white matter of the brain [ Frohman 2006]. Pathogenic 
activation of B cells is considered a key driver in the maintenance of active inflammation in MS. 
Recent studies in patients with MS have established B cells as a clinically validated target cell 
type in MS [ Hauser 2017; Milo 2016; Montalban 2017]. In addition to B cells, there is a body of 
support for the pathological role of myeloid cells (monocytes, macrophages, DCs, mast cells, and 
granulocytes) in MS [ Croxford 2015; Mildner 2009; Yamasaki 2014].
3.2.2. Current Therapies for Multiple Sclerosis
Many currently approved therapies are associated with burdensome monitoring, troublesome 
side effects, or risk of morbidity resulting from susceptibility to serious opportunistic infection. 
Approved therapies also vary in terms of respective efficacy, resulting in significantly differing 
individual benefit-risk profiles.
IFN  therapies and GA, administered by intramuscular or subcutaneous injections, are 
commonly used therapies for RMS, with well-established safety and efficacy profiles. However, 
they are associated with known side effects (flu-like symptoms for IFN ; lipoatrophy and other 
injection site pathologies for GA), which can be a significant burden for some people with MS. 
Additionally, many people continue to experience significant MS disease activity while on 
treatment.
DMF, DRF, siponimod, fingolimod, teriflunomide, ozanimod, ponesimod, MMF, and cladribine 
are oral disease-modifying therapies approved for the treatment of RMS. While these therapies 
offer an improved route of administration, they each vary in terms of their respective 
mechanisms of action and benefit/risk profiles. People with MS may continue to experience 
disease activity while on these treatments, and a variety of side effects, which may include 
lymphopenia, risk of infections (including rare cases of PML), bradycardia, and hepatotoxicity, Protocol 257MS201, Version 2.0

46may necessitate exclusion of vulnerable patients and in some cases require specialized 
monitoring both during and prior to initiation of therapy.
Other available disease-modifying therapies are associated with risk (albeit low) of serious side 
effects (e.g., PML [natalizumab]; life-threatening autoimmune disorders and autoimmune thyroid 
disease [alemtuzumab]; and cardiotoxicity [mitoxantrone]). Their use is limited in some regions 
by a restricted distribution program or risk-management plan, limited to people with more severe 
diseases, or limited to second- or third-line therapy. Cladribine has also been associated with 
increased risks of infections and severe and prolonged lymphopenia and a higher risk of 
malignancies compared to placebo.
Ocrelizumab, a recombinant, humanized, monoclonal antibody directed against CD20 (which is 
predominantly expressed on B cells), is indicated for the treatment of PPMS as well as RMS and 
is administered as an IV infusion. It is associated with infusion-associated reactions, infections, 
and a possible increased risk of malignancy.
In summary, the choice of therapies entails tradeoffs between efficacy, safety, tolerability, and 
convenience, which makes MS a challenging condition to treat successfully. Based on 
benefit-risk considerations, the most efficacious therapies in RMS are generally reserved for 
patients who have already experienced significant disease activity and disability progression. 
These therapies typically require periodic, ongoing laboratory monitoring and have risks that 
cannot be fully mitigated. Consequently, there remains a high unmet medical need for new MS 
drugs with further improved efficacy and safety profiles.
3.2.3. BIIB091
3.2.3.1. BTK Inhibition
Studies in patients with MS have established B cells as a clinically validated target cell type in 
MS [ Hauser 2017; Hauser 1986; Milo 2016; Montalban 2017]. In addition to B cells, there is a 
body of literature supporting the pathological role of myeloid cells (monocytes, macrophages, 
DCs, mast cells, and granulocytes) in MS [ Croxford 2015; Mildner 2009; Yamasaki 2014].
BTK is a cytoplasmic kinase expressed in many hematopoietic cell types known to be 
dysregulated in MS; it is a key signaling node immediately downstream of the BCR in B cells 
and FcRs in myeloid cells. In B cells, BTK mediates B-cell activation and effector functions 
(such as cytokine secretion and proliferation and differentiation into memory cells and 
antibody-producing cells) downstream of BCR activation [ Corneth 2016] and is required for 
BCR-mediated antigen presentation to T cells [ Benson 2014; Sharma 2009]. In myeloid cells, 
BTK inhibition blocks FcR-dependent proinflammatory activities (including cytokine secretion 
by mast cells, monocytes, and macrophages; ROS generation by neutrophils; and degranulation 
of basophils) triggered by the binding of ICs to FcRs [ Koprulu and Ellmeier 2009].
A summary of BTK-dependent signaling in B cells and myeloid cells is presented in Figure 2.Protocol 257MS201, Version 2.0

47Figure 2: BTK-Dependent Signaling in B Cells and Myeloid Cells
Clinical data demonstrating the benefit of inhibition of the BTK pathway in patients with RMS 
are starting to emerge in the literature. Results from a Phase 2 clinical trial of the covalent 
(irreversible) BTK inhibitor evobrutinib in RMS demonstrated significantly fewer T1 GdE 
lesions during Weeks 12 through Weeks 24 in the evobrutinib 75 mg QD group compared to 
placebo [Montalban 2019]. Additionally, a Phase 2 clinical trial of the covalent (irreversible) 
BTK inhibitor tolebrutinib (SAR442168) in RMS demonstrated a significant reduction in the 
number of new T1 GdE and new or enlarging T2 hyperintense lesions at 12 weeks in the 
tolebrutinib 60 mg QD group compared to placebo [Reich 2021].
3.2.3.2. BIIB091 Mechanism of Action
BIIB091 is an orally active, potent, selective, reversible (noncovalent), small-molecule BTK 
inhibitor, a member of the TEC family of protein tyrosine kinases. It is being developed for the 
treatment of MS, including RMS and PPMS.
Based on its antagonism of BTK-dependent functions in multiple cell types, BIIB091 has the 
potential to suppress both BCR-mediated and IC/FcR-mediated antigen presentation to T cells, 
as well as other FcR-dependent functions, such as cytokine secretion, ROS generation, and cell 
degranulation (Figure 3). As a result, BIIB091 has the potential to inhibit multiple pathological 
drivers of MS across the spectrum of the disease, from RMS through PPMS.

48Figure 3: BIIB091 Targets Myeloid Cells and Shares Mechanisms of Action with 
B-Cell-Depleting Agents
(A) Due to insufficient saturation of CD20 and lack of the lytic molecular and cellular machinery in CNS, the main 
MOA of B-cell depleting agents is thought to be peripheral in CNS-draining lymphoid organs, such as cervical 
lymph nodes. (B) Similar to B-cell depletion, BIIB091 will block peripheral B-cell functions, including cytokine and 
chemokine secretion, antibody production, and, importantly, antigen presentation to T cells, which is thought to be 
the critical MOA of B-cell-depleting agents in MS. BIIB091 is anticipated to block B-cell functions without the 
potential safety liability associated with B-cell depletion. As a second differentiating property, BIIB091 potency will 
not be impacted by the local tissue environment surrounding target cells, in contrast to antibody-mediated B-cell 
depletion, which is reported to be less effective in solid tissues than in blood and only partially effective in some 
cellular contexts, such as GCs. Third, and most importantly, neither B-cell depletion nor BIIB091 is expected to 
impact plasma cells and pre-existing titers of most autoantibodies. By contrast, BIIB091, but not B-cell-depleting 
agents, will uniquely block the pathogenic effects of ICs resulting from the binding of autoantibodies to CNS 
antigens. By blocking FcR signaling, BIIB091 will block IC/FcR-mediated pathogenic effector functions in myeloid 
cells, among which are IC-mediated antigen presentation to T cells, secretion of cytokine and proinflammatory 
mediators, and ROS and protease generation.
3.2.3.3. Profile of Previous Experience With BIIB091
BIIB091 is an orally administered, potent, selective, noncovalent (reversible), and peripherally 
restricted small-molecule inhibitor of BTK. In a biochemical binding assay, BIIB091 exhibited 
> 500-fold selectivity for BTK relative to all other kinases tested out of a panel of > 400 kinases.

49inhibited human B-cell activation with IC 50 at 5.4 nM and 87 nM, respectively, as assessed by 
inhibition of CD69 upregulation. Based on clinical and nonclinical data, the main pharmacologic 
activity of BIIB091 depends on the circulating levels of the compound and is quickly reversible 
as the drug is cleared. Based on data from the first-in-human Study 257HV101 and 
Study 257HV105 Part 1B, median t  ranged from 6 to 16 hours across all dose levels. Thus, 
BIIB091 may couple robust efficacy in quieting circulating inflammatory cells with the ability to 
restore immune functions rapidly after discontinuation when vaccination or management of AEs 
is needed. The inherent reversibility of the proposed key pharmacologic activity supports the 
exploration of BIIB091 as an efficacious, differentiated therapy for patients with MS.
Part 1B data from the Phase 1 formulation PK study, Study 257HV105, demonstrated that the 
administration of the BIIB091 IR tablet formulation at 250 mg twice on Day 1 (12 hours apart) 
in the fasted state and at 350 mg twice on Day 1 (12 hours apart) under the fed state resulted in a 
mean C max < 4018 ng/mL and a mean C trough > 221 ng/mL. In addition, simulated data at steady 
state from the popPK model based on Study 257HV101 and Part 1B of Study 257HV105 
supported a dose range of 200 to 350 mg with BID dosing based on achieving the above 
thresholds. The BIIB091 350 mg dose, when administered as a single-dose and in a 2-dose 
regimen in Part 1B of Study 257HV105, was well tolerated and is anticipated to achieve > 90% 
of CD69 inhibition in B cells in > 90% of treated participants at steady state.
Key aspects of the BIIB091 safety profile are described in Section 3.3; see the BIIB091 IB for 
detailed information on relevant nonclinical and clinical studies.
3.2.4. Diroximel Fumarate
The di-ester fumarates (including DMF and DRF) have been approved by the US FDA under the 
trade name Tecfidera and Vumerity for the treatment of RMS, including CIS, RRMS, and active 
SPMS, in adults [ TECFIDERA USPI 2022; VUMERITY USPI 2022]. DMF and DRF have 
been approved by the EMA for the treatment of adult patients with RRMS [ Tecfidera SmPC 
2022 ; Vumerity SmPC 2022], and both drugs are also approved in other countries.
3.2.4.1. Diroximel Fumarate Mechanism of Action
DMF and DRF, when orally administered as 240 and 462 mg, respectively, are both metabolized 
to the same active metabolite MMF with bioequivalent levels of exposure. DRF is also 
metabolized to HES; however, this is an inactive metabolite. Hence, the systemic safety and 
efficacy profiles of both treatments are similar. In 2 global Phase 3 studies (EVOLVE-MS-1 and 
EVOLVE-MS-2), the DRF dose regimen demonstrated favorable safety and tolerability. 
Additionally, in Study EVOLVE-MS-2, the duration, incidence, and severity of 
participant-reported GI symptoms were significantly lower compared to treatment with DMF 
[Wray 2022]. 
The MOA of fumarate esters is unknown but appears to be partly mediated through activation of 
the Nrf2 antioxidant response pathway [ Nguyen 2003]. DMF has been shown to increase the 
proportion of nave T cells and frequencies of T regulatory and Th2 subsets, while decreasing 
memory T cells, Th1, and Th17 T-cell subsets [ Mehta 2019; Mills 2018]. Similarly, B cell, Protocol 257MS201, Version 2.0

50myeloid, and natural killer populations are also shifted toward a more anti-inflammatory state 
[Mills 2018]. On the other hand, DMF may have minimal impact on B-cell activation or 
antibody production. A recent study showed that DMF treatment for 2 years had no effect on Ig 
isotype concentrations [ Longbrake 2020]. In a study comparing the vaccine responses, DMF-
treated patients were able to mount immune responses to recall antigens, neoantigens, and T-
cell-independent antigens that were comparable to the responses in IFN-treated patients [ von 
Hehn 2018]. In addition, it has been demonstrated that BCR-mediated activation of B cells is not 
inhibited in DMF-treated MS patients (Biogen internal data).
3.3. Benefit-Risk Assessment
Detailed information about the known and expected benefits and risks and reasonably expected 
AEs of BIIB091 and DRF is provided in the BIIB091 IB, the DRF IB, and the ICF for this study. 
A high-level summary of those benefits and risks known during study design is provided here.
3.3.1. BIIB091 Monotherapy Benefit-Risk Assessment
BIIB091 is hypothesized to provide clinical benefits in people with MS as a group mainly 
through selectively and reversibly targeting BTK-related functions in B cells and myeloid cells. 
(See Section 3.3.3 for data on next-generation BTK inhibitors currently in later stages of 
development in MS.)
The potential risks related to participation in this study are justified by the anticipated benefit to 
participants.
QTc prolongation is an identified risk with BIIB091. It was dose dependent and observed at the 
higher exposures in the first-in-human Phase 1 Study 257HV101. Based on that data, the mean 
Cmax exposure limit was set at 4018 ng/mL in the formulation development PK study 257HV105 
to ensure that participants would not encounter any clinically significant QTc prolongation. 
Study 257HV105 was designed to optimize and select a BIIB091 formulation.
In Study 257HV101 (BIIB091 IR capsule formulation) and with available data from 
Study 257HV105 (BIIB091 modified release formulations at doses ranging from 150 to 500 mg 
and the IR tablet formulation at doses ranging from 150 to 350 mg), there were no AEs reported 
in association with QT/QTc prolongation, ventricular tachyarrhythmia, or other cardiac AEs. 
BIIB091 did not have a clinically relevant effect on heart rate or blood pressure. Additionally, 
there were no deaths, no SAEs, or severe AEs reported.
Moreover, observed mean BIIB091 exposure levels in the formulation development PK study 
257HV105 have not exceeded the set C max level, and it is not anticipated that doses selected for 
this Phase 2 study would result in an exposure that would exceed that set mean C max. Based on 
nonclinical data, CYP3A4 inhibition is predicted to produce an approximately 2.2-fold increase 
in BIIB091 exposure. However, clinical data for DDI are not yet available. To avoid higher than 
expected exposure levels, participants receiving CYP3A4 inhibitors will not be allowed to enter 
the Phase 2 study, and CYP3A4 inhibitors will not be allowed during the study. Protocol 257MS201, Version 2.0

51The Phase 2 study will continue to follow risk mitigation measures for QT/QTc prolongation, 
which will include intensive triplicate 12-lead ECGs during the first month of dosing in all 
participants. Additional risk mitigations for the QT/QTc prolongation will be reflected in the 
inclusion and exclusion criteria, discontinuation criteria, and when applicable, study stopping 
criteria.
The risk of infections with BTK inhibitors varies. Over half of patients taking ibrutinib or 
acalabrutinib for oncology indications (first- and second-generation BTK inhibitors, 
respectively) experience an infectious event of any grade. These 2 BTK inhibitors have been 
associated with serious fungal infections such as aspergillosis in patients with cancer 
[Alkharabsheh 2021; Lipsky and Lamanna 2020; Tillman 2018; Varughese 2018]. 
By comparison, next-generation BTK inhibitors such as fenebrutinib and evobrutinib studied in 
autoimmune diseases show less frequent infectious events. Among fenebrutinib-treated 
individuals with rheumatoid arthritis, 8% to 15% of patients had any infection at 12 weeks, with 
a similar percentage in the placebo group (15%) [ Cohen 2020]. Among evobrutinib-treated 
individuals with MS, 19% to 33% of patients had any infection at 24 weeks, with a similar 
percentage in the placebo group (30%) [ Montalban 2019]. This pattern of results may be due to 
the greater target selectivity of next-generation BTK inhibitors. In addition, much of the data 
regarding general infections with BTK inhibitors are from studies of individuals with 
malignancies who may have higher risks of infection, even in the absence of therapy [ Weber 
2021]. 
BIIB091 is a next-generation BTK inhibitor that causes reversible and selective 
immunomodulation of the BTK pathway. As a result of the proposed MOA of BIIB091, there is 
potential for an increased risk of infection. However, to date, there is no evidence of increased 
risk of infections in human volunteers based on the available limited clinical data.
General risk mitigation for infections will be implemented. Participants must have a normal 
WBC and ALC to participate in the study. Symptoms suggestive of infections and temperature 
checks for signs of a fever (> 37.5C) will be assessed at Screening and throughout the study. 
COVID-19-specific risk mitigations will also be implemented in accordance with the Sponsors 
monitoring and prevention control measures for SARS-CoV-2 infection and will be amended 
based on emerging local, regional, and national guidance. An IDMC will review the clinical data 
and make recommendations regarding the study conduct.
Additionally, hemorrhage and bleeding have been described as class side effects for earlier 
generation BTK inhibitors [ von Hundelshausen and Siess 2021], hence monitoring for potential 
BIIB091 effects on platelet function will be implemented in this study. Also, hepatic events have 
been reported with other BTK inhibitors in late-phase clinical development [ Montalban 2019; 
Sanofi 2022]. A more conservative approach was taken for the relevant inclusion and exclusion 
criteria (Section 6.1 and Section 6.2, respectively), as well as the monitoring plan for liver 
function tests, as detailed in Section 8.2.Protocol 257MS201, Version 2.0

523.3.2. Diroximel Fumarate Monotherapy Benefit-Risk Assessment
DRF has been approved by the US FDA for the treatment of adults with RMS and in the EU for 
the treatment of RRMS [ VUMERITY USPI 2022; Vumerity SmPC 2022], and it was 
subsequently approved in several countries. In participants with RRMS, DRF demonstrated 
safety and tolerability in 2 global Phase 3 studies (see the DRF IB for details). The approval for 
DRF relied on the efficacy and, in part, on the prior findings of safety for the listed treatment 
DMF, marketed as Tecfidera [ TECFIDERA USPI 2022; Tecfidera SmPC 2022].
The safety profile of DRF relies on the well-known safety profile of DMF. Important identified 
risks for DMF, and hence DRF, include PML and decreases in leukocyte/lymphocyte counts; 
flushing and GI events (abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting) are among the most 
commonly experienced AEs with DMF. Data from DRF study ALK8700-A302 
(EVOLVE-MS-2) showed that over a 5-week treatment period, DRF showed a 46% reduction in 
the number of days patients experienced GI symptoms when compared with DMF. Moreover, 
data from Study ALK8700A301, a 96-week open-label study of 1057 MS patients, showed DRF 
safety data comparable to that of DMF, and no new safety signals have been identified. 
In conclusion, DRF has a similar efficacy and safety profile as DMF, with fewer GI issues. 
DRF will be included as monotherapy in Part 1 and Part 2 of this study and also evaluated in a 
combination therapy regimen with BIIB091 in Part 2 of this study.
Risk mitigation for DRF in this study will include monitoring for ALC, leucocyte counts, liver 
function, and opportunistic and other infections. It will also include treatment withholding or 
discontinuation if safety thresholds are met for these items. Additional risk mitigations specific 
to DRF will be reflected in the inclusion and exclusion criteria, discontinuation criteria, and 
when applicable, study stopping criteria. An IDMC will review the clinical data and make 
recommendations regarding the study conduct.
3.3.3. BIIB091 and Diroximel Fumarate Combination Therapy Benefit-Risk 
Assessment
The combination therapy of BIIB091 and DRF is not expected to have a compounding effect on 
QTc. The DRF TQT study (Study ALK8700-A110) showed that DRF treatment did not have a 
clinically relevant effect on QTc in humans. Lymphopenia may be observed with DRF, mostly 
impacting CD4 and CD8 T cells with an initial decline and stabilization by 24 weeks. While 
BIIB091 exerts its effects on B cells, it is not a B-cell-depleting agent and, therefore, BIIB091 is 
not expected to cause additive lymphopenia (no AEs of lymphopenia were reported in 
> 1 participant in the MAD part of Study 257HV101). Additionally, DRF may cause an elevation 
in hepatic transaminases as anticipated from the DMF data where the active metabolite is the 
same as DRF (most were  3  ULN, and these abnormalities resolve upon DMF 
discontinuation). With the limited clinical data available (data from Study 257HV101 and 
interim data for Part 1 and Part 1B of Study 257HV105), there is no evidence of increased risk of 
elevation in liver enzymes with BIIB091 treatment (see the BIIB091 IB and DRF IB for details). 
The monitoring plan for liver enzymes is detailed in Section 8.1.Protocol 257MS201, Version 2.0

53There is a theoretical risk for increased infections with the combination treatment despite having 
a minimally overlapping MOA. Based on available data from other next-generation BTK 
inhibitors clinical studies in later stages of development, there is no anticipated increased risk of 
serious infections with BIIB091. Fenebrutinib Phase 2 studies in autoimmune diseases reported 
serious infections in 6 patients (2%) in combined fenebrutinib cohorts and 5 patients (1.8%) in 
the combined placebo cohorts with no imbalance in pattern, duration, seriousness, or severity of 
infection in patients receiving fenebrutinib versus placebo despite a background of the use of 
immunosuppressants [ Oh 2021].
Risk mitigations for infections were outlined for each drug separately. Furthermore, there will be 
additional risk mitigations for serious infections that will be implemented in this study with close 
monitoring of ALC, leukocytes count, and Ig levels. Additional risk mitigations specific to the 
combination treatment will be reflected in the inclusion and exclusion criteria, discontinuation 
criteria, and when applicable, study stopping criteria.
To support the proposed combination clinical study, the Sponsor has conducted a 90-day, 
GLP-compliant combination toxicology study of BIIB091 and DRF in monkeys. In this 
combination toxicology study, the following results were observed: nonadverse increases in heart 
rate (observed in the combination arm; not biologically significant) and nonadverse hematology 
changes (decreases in red blood cell mass indices and increases in reticulocytes; and observed in 
the BIIB091 arm and in previous BIIB091 studies, and was, therefore, likely attributable to 
BIIB091). In this nonclinical combination study, no QTc changes were observed, and no findings 
were indicative of additive or synergistic effects.
To mitigate risks in the study, an IDMC will review the clinical data and make recommendations 
regarding the study conduct (Section 14.3.2).
3.3.4. Overall Benefit-Risk Assessment
As with many clinical studies, there is a burden for participants in this clinical study, which 
includes 12 scheduled study visits, up to 14 blood sample collections, 8 scheduled MRI tests, 
physical discomfort from participation, and time spent on completing assessment questionnaires. 
Despite that, participants in this study are expected to benefit from intensive monitoring of their 
disease and its state. Moreover, all participants will be receiving a form of active drug (either 
BIIB091, DRF, or both) that is expected to have a positive impact on their disease. This is not a 
placebo-controlled study (see Section 7.3.3 for details).
In conclusion, BIIB091 has an acceptable safety profile, has an established MOA, and belongs to 
the class of next-generation BTK inhibitors that are showing promising results in completed 
Phase 2 MS clinical trials [ Montalban 2019; Reich 2021]. Additionally, DRF has an established 
safety profile and is approved in the US for the treatment of RMS, in the EU for the treatment of 
RRMS, and in other countries. Considering the minimally overlapping MOA, toxicology 
combination therapy data, outlined risk mitigation strategies, and the need for highly efficacious 
oral therapies in MS, testing the combination of BIIB091 with DRF in the Phase 2 study would 
provide a favorable benefit-risk profile.Protocol 257MS201, Version 2.0

585. STUDY DESIGN
5.1. Study Overview
This is a 2-part, multicenter, randomized, blinded, active-controlled Phase 2 study to sequentially 
evaluate the safety and efficacy of BIIB091 monotherapy and BIIB091 combination therapy with 
DRF in approximately 275 participants with RMS. This study will be conducted at 
approximately 80 sites globally. 
Randomization will be performed using IRT. In Part 1, participants will be randomized in a 2:2:1 
ratio to the monotherapy of either the proposed high-dose (350 mg) BIIB091 group, the low-dose 
(250 mg BID) BIIB091 group, or the standard-dose (462 mg BID) DRF group, respectively. 
In Part 2, participants will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to the selected BIIB091 dose with the 
standard-dose (462 mg BID) DRF combination therapy group, the selected BIIB091 dose with 
the low-dose (350 mg BID) DRF combination therapy group, or the standard-dose (462 mg BID) 
DRF monotherapy group, respectively. (Note: the selected BIIB091 dose for Part 2 will be 
determined following Part 1 [Week 16] analysis.) In both Part 1 and Part 2, the randomization 
will be stratified by intensive PK cohort (Yes/No) and region (Eastern Europe vs. Other). 
For stratification, Eastern Europe will include participants from countries such as Poland and the 
Czech Republic.
See Figure 1 for a schematic of the study design. 
5.1.1. Part 1
Part 1 will include a 4-week screening period; a 16-week double-blind, active-controlled 
treatment period; a 32-week blinded, active-controlled treatment period; and a 2-week 
post-treatment safety follow-up period. Participants with active RMS will be randomized to 
3 treatment groups: high-dose BIIB091 monotherapy (350 mg BID), low-dose BIIB091 
monotherapy (250 mg BID), and DRF monotherapy at the standard dose (462 mg BID). 
The primary analysis of the Part 1 primary, secondary, and selected exploratory endpoints will be 
performed after all participants complete the 16-week visit. The primary objective of Part 1 of 
the study is to investigate the safety and tolerability of BIIB091 monotherapy in participants with 
RMS. As detailed in the BIIB091 IB, AESIs include ventricular tachyarrhythmia, clinically 
significant QT prolongation, and hepatic events. BIIB091 has a relatively short half-life, and 
multiple dosing periods in the Phase 1 studies have shown that the exposure reaches a steady 
state within 5 to 7 days. The primary analysis at 16 weeks would allow a sufficient time period 
for signal detection with intensive monitoring of AEs, safety laboratory assessments, and ECGs. 
Additionally, subsequent to the Week 16 analysis, a longer period of safety monitoring for 
BIIB091 monotherapy will continue until Week 48.
An IDMC will review the safety and laboratory data from the Part 1, Week 16 primary analysis 
and make a recommendation to the Sponsor on whether to initiate Part 2 (see Section 12.8 and Protocol 257MS201, Version 2.0

59Section 14.3.2 for details). In the event of unfavorable safety findings, the IDMC could 
recommend pausing or stopping a cohort or the study or recommend a modification to the study 
design. Details regarding the IDMC review of data will be provided in the IDMC charter. 
The Week 16 primary efficacy analysis in Part 1 would allow for a sufficient period to detect a 
meaningful effect on MRI lesions to support further development of BIIB091. Phase 2 studies 
with primary endpoints measured after a 12- to 24-week controlled treatment phase are common 
in RMS [ Kappos 2008; Montalban 2019; Traboulsee 2020]. The efficacy signals in tolebrutinib 
were also observed within this time period [ Reich 2021]. Clinical and MRI data from the entire 
48-week study treatment period will be analyzed as exploratory endpoints.
Selected Sponsor team members will be unblinded to participate in the primary analysis of Part 1 
data at Week 16 (see Section 14.3.1 for details). This team will review the Part 1, Week 16 safety 
and efficacy data and confirm whether to proceed to Part 2 (based on the overall benefit-risk 
profile) and select the BIIB091 dose to be used in Part 2 ( Figure 1). If the study were to be 
stopped, participants would not complete Part 1, and the study would not proceed to Part 2.
5.1.2. Part 2
Part 2 will include a 4-week screening period; a 16-week double-blind, active-controlled 
treatment period; a 32-week blinded, active-controlled treatment period; and a 2-week 
post-treatment safety follow-up period. Participants with RMS will be randomized to 3 treatment 
groups: the selected BIIB091 dose in combination with the standard dose (462 mg BID) of DRF, 
the selected BIIB091 dose in combination with the lower dose (350 mg BID) of DRF, and DRF 
monotherapy at the standard dose (462 mg BID). The primary analysis comparing the 
BIIB091/DRF combination therapy to DRF monotherapy will be performed after all participants 
complete the Week 16 visit in Part 2. 
Selected Sponsor team members who were unblinded for the 16-week primary analysis of Part 1 
data will also participate in the 16-week primary analysis of Part 2 safety and efficacy data (see 
Section 14.3.1 for details).
Final analysis of the 48-week data from Part 1 and Part 2 will allow for the assessment of 
longer-term safety and efficacy (clinical and imaging treatment effects) of BIIB091 monotherapy 
and BIIB091 combination therapy with DRF. For maintenance of blinding, members of the study 
management team who are not involved in the Week 16 data review (in Part 1 and Part 2) and 
the study sites will remain blinded for the entire duration of the study (Section 7.4). Details on 
how the study blind is maintained will be provided in a separate unblinding plan.
5.2. Study Duration for Participants
Participants in Part 1 of the study cannot participate in Part 2 of the study. In Part 1 and Part 2, 
the total study duration for each participant will be up to 54 weeks and includes the following:

6016-week double-blind, active-controlled treatment period
32-week blinded, active-controlled treatment period
2-week post-treatment safety follow-up period
Participants will have up to 12 scheduled visits during the study. All visits should be performed 
 2 to 5 days from the nominal visit day. Visit days are calculated with respect to Day 1 (the date 
of the first dose).
The ET Visit is a visit where Week 48 assessments are performed for participants who withdraw 
from the study early. 
The EOT date is the date at which the last dose of study treatment is administered (Week 48 for 
treatment period completers and at any time during the blinded treatment period for participants 
who permanently discontinue study treatment early or withdraw from the study early).
The EOS date for a participant may be the last study visit, last follow-up telephone conversation, 
or last protocol-specified assessment, or if the participant has ongoing AEs that are being 
followed, the date may be the date of AE resolution.
Participants will complete protocol-specified assessments according to the Schedule of Activities 
(Table 1). 
5.2.1. Screening Period 
During the screening period for both Part 1 and Part 2, participants who sign the ICF will 
undergo all screening procedures to determine their eligibility to participate in the study. Eligible 
participants who meet all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria as specified 
in Section 6 will be randomized and enter the Part 1 or Part 2 treatment period 
(see Section 6.3.2).
Screening of participants for Part 2 will depend on the review of Part 1, Week 16 data by the 
IDMC and a decision from the select unblinded Sponsor team members to proceed to Part 2 of 
the study.
5.2.2. Randomization (Day 1)
For both Part 1 and Part 2, on Day 1, the Investigator should ensure that the participant meets the 
eligibility criteria and undergoes all Day 1 assessments according to the Schedule of Activities 
(Table 1). Only participants confirmed to be eligible will be randomized and receive study 
treatment.
Randomization will be performed using IRT. In Part 1, participants will be randomized in a 2:2:1 
ratio to the monotherapy of either the proposed high dose (350 mg) BIIB091 group, the low-dose 
(250 mg BID) BIIB091 group, or the standard-dose (462 mg BID) DRF group, respectively. 
In Part 2, participants will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to the selected BIIB091 dose with Protocol 257MS201, Version 2.0

DRF monotherapy group, respectively. (Note: the selected BIIB091 dose for Part 2 will be 
determined following Part 1 [Week 16] analysis.) In both Part 1 and Part 2, the randomization 
will be stratified by intensive PK cohort (Yes/No) and region (Eastern Europe vs. Other). 
For stratification, Eastern Europe will include participants from countries such as Poland and the 
Czech Republic.
5.2.3. Treatment Period (Day 1  Week 48)
For both Part 1 and Part 2, participants will visit the study site for safety, MRI, and clinical 
efficacy assessments from Day -28 to Day 1 (MRI assessments should be completed at least 
7 calendar days and no more than 14 calendar days prior to Baseline [Day 1]) and Weeks 4, 8, 
12, 16, 24, and 48. Additional specific safety assessments will be performed at Weeks 1, 2, 6, 36, 
and 50. The primary efficacy endpoint in Part 2 will be the cumulative number of new T1 GdE 
lesions at Weeks 8, 12, and 16. For Part 1 and Part 2, the last dose of study treatment will be 
administered on Week 48. 
For both Part 1 and Part 2, all participants, Investigators, and the study management team will be 
blinded to participant treatment assignments before all participants complete the first 16-week 
visit. Only selected Sponsor team members will be unblinded to participate in the 16-week data 
analyses (see Section 14.3.1). All participants, Investigators, and the remaining study 
management team members, especially those directly interacting with study sites, will remain 
strictly blinded for the study, including the 48-week controlled treatment period and the 2-week 
safety follow-up period. To further maintain blinding, each study site will have a treating 
neurologist and an examining neurologist. The treating neurologist will function as the primary 
treating physician and will conduct all participant safety assessments. The examining neurologist 
will conduct all EDSS evaluations and relapse assessments but will not be involved in any other 
aspect of participant care.
Participants will complete protocol-specified assessments according to the Schedule of Activities 
(Table 1). All screening assessments will be completed prior to administration of study 
treatment. The PRO questionnaires should be completed by the participant (unassisted by the 
spouse, family members, legal guardian, friends, site staff, or trained healthcare professionals) 
prior to all other assessments and prior to the study treatment administration, as disease 
assessments/clinical evaluations may confound the results.
5.2.4. End of Treatment Period (Week 48/ET)
The end of the blinded, active-controlled treatment period is Week 48 for both Part 1 and Part 2.
Participants who remain in the study through the 48-week treatment period are considered to 
have successfully completed the treatment period. Participants who complete Part 1 will not 
participate in Part 2. Protocol 257MS201, Version 2.0

CONFIDENTIAL
The information contained herein may not be used, disclosed, or published without the written consent of

62Participants in Part 1 and Part 2 who do not remain in the study through Week 48 are considered 
to have discontinued study treatment early. Participants who discontinue study treatment early 
are encouraged to remain in the study and continue protocol-required tests and assessments 
through the EOS and Follow-Up Visits and would not complete an ET Visit.
Participants in Part 1 and Part 2 who withdraw from study participation and do not complete the 
48-week treatment period should complete the ET Visit at the time of withdrawal and are also 
encouraged to complete the blinded post-treatment Follow-Up Visit, unless withdrawal is due to 
death or withdrawal of consent.
5.2.5. Safety Follow-up Period (2-week Period)
Participants will complete protocol-specified safety assessments according to the Schedule of 
Activities ( Table 1). Participants with ALC < LLN at the 2-week safety Follow-Up Visit will 
return in 2 weeks for retesting and confirmation, and follow-up will be extended for those 
participants at intervals of 8 weeks to monitor their lymphocyte counts until their ALC > LLN, 
or for a period up to 6 months, or until they commence another disease-modifying therapy, 
whichever occurs first.
5.3. Relapses
An MS relapse is defined as the onset of new or recurrent neurologic symptoms lasting at least 
24 hours, accompanied by new objective abnormalities on a neurological examination and not 
explained solely by non-MS processes, such as associated with fever, infection, severe sepsis, or 
drug toxicity (adapted from [ Schumacher 1965]). The participant must have objective signs on 
the examining neurologists examination confirming the event. New or recurrent neurologic 
symptoms that evolve gradually over months should be considered disease progression, not an 
acute relapse, and should not be treated with steroids. New or recurrent neurologic symptoms 
that occur less than 30 days following the onset of a protocol-defined relapse should be 
considered part of the same relapse and would not be treated with IVMP within the protocol.
Participants who experience new neurologic symptoms must contact the treating neurologist or 
treating nurse within 48 hours of the onset of symptoms to complete a telephone questionnaire to 
determine the necessity of an unscheduled Relapse Assessment Visit. If required, the participant 
will then be evaluated in person by the treating neurologist within 72 hours of the onset of the 
potential relapse. If, in the opinion of the treating neurologist, an MS relapse may have occurred, 
the participant must also be evaluated by the examining neurologist within 5 days of the onset of 
the symptoms. The examining neurologist is to perform a detailed neurologic examination and 
obtain an EDSS score. New objective findings on a neurological examination performed by the 
examining neurologist are required to confirm that a protocol-defined relapse has occurred. 
Participants may not begin corticosteroid treatment of the relapse per protocol until after the 
examining neurologist has examined them. The examining neurologist is permitted to report the 
examination findings to the treating neurologist so they can evaluate treatment options.Protocol 257MS201, Version 2.0

63Relapse Assessment Visits are to be conducted within 72 hours of the onset of any new or 
worsening neurologic symptom(s) or suspected protocol-defined relapse. Unscheduled Relapse 
Assessment Visits should not modify or replace the participants visit schedule. 
5.3.1.1. Treatment of Relapses on Scheduled or Unscheduled Visits
Treatment of an acute relapse event may proceed at the discretion of the treating neurologist only 
after the examining neurologist has completed their examination and after a Gd-enhancing MRI 
of the brain has been performed (if considered necessary by the treating neurologist) [ Table 1]. 
Participants in the Czech Republic must begin treatment for an acute relapse within 5 days of 
symptom onset, even if the MRI scan has not yet been performed. The treatment for relapse in 
this study is IVMP  1000 mg/day for up to a maximum of 5 days with or without an oral 
prednisone taper (up to 15 days). Methylprednisolone can be given once a day or in divided 
doses. Any changes to this treatment should first be discussed with the Sponsor Medical Director 
or designee. Steroid retreatment of the same relapse (see Section 5.3) is not allowed unless 
approved by the Sponsor Medical Director or designee. Study treatment dosing is to continue 
uninterrupted during IVMP treatment.
If the start of treatment for relapse with high-dose corticosteroids falls within 7 days of the next 
scheduled visit, every attempt should be made to obtain the MRI before administration of the 
first dose of high-dose corticosteroids. If outside the visit window, the visit should be recorded as 
unscheduled. The MRI at an unscheduled visit prior to steroid treatment must be  21 days after 
the prior MRI. However, if an MRI at an unscheduled visit is < 21 days after a prior MRI, then 
the use of Gd should be strongly avoided, unless determined by the Investigator to be clinically 
indicated. In this scenario, the next regularly scheduled MRI should also be obtained.
5.4. Other Considerations
5.4.1.1.  SARS-CoV-2 Impact
Details on precautionary measures, including vaccination, because of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 
pandemic are described in Appendix 1. 
5.5. Study Stopping Rules
Safety data will be reviewed on a continual basis throughout the study. In the event of 
unfavorable safety findings, the IDMC could recommend that the Sponsor stop the study or take 
other actions (see Section 14.3.2 for details).

6.3. Screening, Retesting, and Screen Failures
6.3.1. Screening
Once informed consent is obtained, screening assessments can occur. At this time, a unique 
identification number is assigned that will be used on study-related documents pertaining to the 
participant. Any identification numbers that are assigned will not be reused even if the 
participant fails screening, does not receive treatment, or does not continue in the study. Study 
sites are required to document all screened participants initially considered for inclusion in the 
study. 
6.3.2. Retesting
Participants who have an out-of-range result that is not clinically significant at the Screening 
Visit can be retested once at the discretion of the Investigator. In addition, eligible participants 
who are not able to complete the Baseline Visit (Day 1) within 4 weeks of starting their 
screening assessments may be rescreened. Participants who had a relapse within 30 days prior to 
randomization (Day 1) and who received disallowed concomitant medications can be rescreened 
at a later timepoint to meet the enrollment criteria.
If the participant fails screening twice, they may not undergo further screening for this study.
6.3.3. Screen Failures
Participants who fail the following screening criteria cannot be retested and are considered 
screen failures: 
Positive HIV, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C testing 
AST or ALT  2  ULN
Screen failures are defined as participants who sign the ICF but are not subsequently randomized 
or dosed. If a participant is considered a screen failure, the reasons for exclusion must be 
documented in the participants source documents and on the screening log. A minimal set of Protocol 257MS201, Version 2.0

737. STUDY TREATMENT 
7.1. Regimen
In both Part 1 and Part 2, BIIB091 will be dosed with the IR tablet formulation BID via oral 
administration after regular meals (within 30 to 60 minutes after meals) for a total of 48 weeks. 
BIIB091 should not be taken in the fasted state. In Part 1, BIIB091 350 mg BID and 250 mg BID 
will be used as the high dose and low dose, respectively. In Part 2, the BIIB091 dose will be 
selected based on benefit-risk evaluation of Part 1 data (rationale for dosing is discussed in 
Section 3.1.2).
DRF will be supplied as HPMC capsules consisting of enteric-coated, pH-sensitive DRF 
minitablets. In both Part 1 and Part 2, participants treated with the standard-dose DRF will take 
the starting dose of 231 mg BID for the first 7 days and then 462 mg BID thereafter. In Part 2, 
participants receiving the BIIB091 and low-dose DRF combination therapy will take DRF 
231 mg BID for the first 7 days and then 350 mg BID thereafter. 
In Part 1 and Part 2, participants will be dosed with study treatment every 12 hours. Missed 
doses should be taken within 4 hours. If the participant does not remember to take the dose 
within 4 hours, this dose should be skipped and the next dose should be taken as scheduled. Any 
2 doses of study treatment should be separated by  8 hours. Doses should not be doubled to 
make up for the missed doses. All doses administered, whether in the clinic or at home, must be 
recorded on the Patient Diary; see Section 7.6 for further details.
Participants will be randomized into treatment groups as shown below. Individual participants 
will have up to 12 scheduled study visits. Participants in Part 1 of the study cannot participate in 
Part 2 of the study. The randomization will be stratified by intensive PK cohort (Yes/No) and 
region (Eastern Europe vs. Other). For stratification, Eastern Europe will include participants 
from countries such as Poland and the Czech Republic.

77Unless otherwise notified, all bottles, both used and unused, must be saved for study treatment 
accountability. By the end of the study, reconciliation must be made among the amount of DRF 
supplied, dispensed, and subsequently destroyed, lost, or returned to the Sponsor. A written 
explanation must be provided for any discrepancies.
7.3.3. Placebo
In order to maintain blinding for participants in the study (to disguise both the type of study drug 
and dose level), active study treatment (BIIB091 or DRF) will be administered together with 
placebo. Placebo will be of the same appearance (BIIB091 placebo matching the appearance of 
the BIIB091 tablet and DRF placebo matching the appearance of the DRF capsule).
Corresponding information as provided for the active study treatment (BIIB091 or DRF) is 
applicable to the matching placebos (BIIB091 placebo or DRF placebo, respectively), with the 
exception that the placebos contain listed excipients only.
7.3.4. Other Protocol-Designated Products
7.3.4.1. Auxiliary Medicinal Products: Gadolinium and Intravenous Methylprednisolone
An auxiliary medicinal product is a medicinal product used for the needs of a clinical trial as 
described in the protocol but is not an investigational medicinal product. It could include 
medicinal products used for background treatment, challenge agents, or rescue medication, or it 
could be used to assess endpoints in a clinical trial. Authorized auxiliary medicinal product refers 
to a medicinal product authorized in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, or in any 
Member State concerned in accordance with Directive 2001/83/EC. An unauthorized auxiliary 
medicinal product is one without such authorization. 
This study uses the auxiliary medicinal products Gd-based contrast agents/media (ATC code: 
V08CA) and IVMP. 
Gd-based contrast agents/media must have a marketing authorization. Sites will use the Gd-
based contrast agents/media currently approved in the local country, according to the 
SmPC/USPI/local label, as applicable.
IVMP of 1000 mg/day up to a total of 5 days and with or without an oral taper was chosen in this 
study protocol. IVMP is authorized for the treatment of MS relapse in the US [ SOLU-
MEDROL USPI 2021]. IVMP is authorized in all participating geographic regions of this 
study. Use in MS relapses at a dose of up to 1000 mg/day for 3 to 5 days is considered an 
acceptable standard of care as noted in EU guidance [ EMA (EMA/CHMP/771815/2011 Rev. 2) 
2015], although the indication may not contain MS relapse in all regions.
Accountability of both products will be conducted as described for the study treatments and 
placebo. Protocol 257MS201, Version 2.0

787.4. Blinding Procedures
For both Part 1 and Part 2, the Investigator, study staff, and participants will remain blinded to 
the treatment assignments during the 48-week study period. To maintain the study blind, it is 
imperative that treatment assignments are not shared with the participants, their families, or any 
member of the blinded study team, both at the site and at the Sponsor and CRO, if applicable. 
Selected Sponsor team members, including Sponsor representatives from Clinical Development, 
Safety, Biomarkers, and Biostatistics will be unblinded to participate in the 16-week data 
analyses in Part 1 and Part 2 (see Section 14.3.1 for details). All participants, Investigators, and 
the remaining study management team members, especially those directly interacting with study 
sites, will remain strictly blinded for the study, including the 48-week controlled treatment 
period and the 2-week safety follow-up period.
To further maintain blinding, each study site will have a treating neurologist and an examining 
neurologist. The treating neurologist will function as the primary treating physician and will 
conduct all participant safety assessments. The examining neurologist will conduct all EDSS 
evaluations and relapse assessments but will not be involved in any other aspect of participant 
care.
At the end of the study (i.e., once the clinical study report is finalized), if unblinding will not 
jeopardize the results of ongoing related studies, the Sponsor will provide the randomization 
codes to Investigators, who then can inform their participants about the treatment received.
In the event of a medical emergency that requires unblinding of a participants treatment 
assignment, refer to Section 11.4.5. 
7.5. Precautions
Medications for the treatment of severe hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., epinephrine for 
subcutaneous injections, diphenhydramine for injection) must be available for immediate use.
See the DHA for detailed instructions.
7.6. Compliance
Participants will receive instructions on compliance with study treatment at the first study visit 
(Baseline Day 1). A Patient Diary will be given to the participant to record intake at home; this 
will be collected by the Investigator or site staff at each visit and a new one will be given to the 
participant for the next visit record. Doses administered at the study site will also be recorded in 
the Patient Diary. Compliance will be monitored by tablet (BIIB091 and the matching placebo) 
or capsule (DRF and the matching placebo) count, conducted by study personnel at protocol-
scheduled visits. Compliance will be assessed by direct questioning, counting of returned tablets 
and capsules, review of the Patient Diary, etc. Deviation(s) from the prescribed dosage regimen 
should be recorded in the eCRF. Insufficient compliance with the protocol-specified dosing 
regimen is defined as taking less than 80% of study medication during any part of the study 
treatment period. Any dose of study drug in excess of that specified in this protocol is considered Protocol 257MS201, Version 2.0

79to be an overdose. Participants should make every effort to complete the Patient Diary as soon as 
they have taken the study medication, but no later than 12 hours afterwards.
7.7. Concomitant Therapy and Procedures
7.7.1. Concomitant Therapy
A concomitant therapy is any drug or substance administered between the participants Baseline 
Visit and the last study visit.
7.7.1.1. Allowed Concomitant Therapy
Participants should be instructed to contact their Investigators before taking any new 
medications, including nonprescription drugs and herbal preparations.
Participants may take up to 3000 mg/day acetaminophen (paracetamol) and up to 100 mg/day 
low-dose aspirin during the study at the discretion of the Investigator. During the study, female 
participants may also take hormone replacement therapy or oral contraceptives that are not 
known to prolong QT/QTc interval (based on each drugs product label and other available 
references such as Woosley et al. [ Woosley 2022]), do not induce or inhibit CYP3A4 [ FDA 
2022], and are not OATP1B1 or B3 substrates. Symptomatic therapy, such as treatment for 
spasticity, depression, or fatigue, is not restricted but should be optimized as early as possible 
during screening to maintain consistent treatment for the duration of the study.
Clinical evidence from non-live COVID-19 vaccine studies showed that highly protective 
immunologic effects are expected within 14 to 21 days after administration of the COVID-19 
vaccine. Since BIIB091 treatment may reduce the immune response to the vaccine if given 
within 21 days after vaccine administration, it is recommended that participants receive the 
SARS-CoV-2 vaccine 21 days or more prior to randomization (for the vaccine to exert its effect), 
as per local regulation, and/or Investigator guidance.
After Week 16 in Part 1 and Part 2, the non-live COVID-19 vaccine may be administered at the 
discretion of the PI. In this case, participants may remain off-treatment for a maximum of 21 
days after administration of the COVID-19 vaccine (for the vaccine to exert its effect) (see 
Appendix 1).
The yearly non-live influenza (flu) vaccine is permitted during the study. Study treatment should 
not be withheld due to the influenza vaccination during the study treatment period. Participants 
are encouraged to receive influenza vaccination 2 to 3 weeks prior to randomization, when 
feasible.
7.7.1.2. Disallowed Concomitant Therapy
Medications and therapies that are prohibited prior to dosing as indicated in Section 6.2 are 
prohibited during the study. Participants should be instructed to contact their Investigators before 
taking any new medications, including nonprescription drugs and herbal preparations.Protocol 257MS201, Version 2.0
Phase 2 Study to Evaluate BIIB091 Monotherapy and BIIB091 Combination Therapy in RMS
CONFIDENTIAL

Biogen MA Inc.
80Participants should not receive any vaccination within 30 days prior to screening, during the 
study, and up to 30 days after the last study visit. However, non-live COVID-19 vaccination and 
the non-live influenza (flu) vaccine will be permitted as described in Section 7.7.1.1. 
During the first 16 weeks of study treatment periods in Part 1 and Part 2, non-live COVID-19 
vaccines are not permitted. COVID-19 vaccines may prompt temporary withholding or 
discontinuation of study treatment in order for the vaccine to exert its effect. Since temporary 
withholding or discontinuation could affect the primary analysis of safety and efficacy of the 
study treatment, COVID-19 vaccines are not allowed during the first 16 weeks of Part 1 and 
Part 2 (see Appendix 1).
Participants who receive any restricted medications (Section 6.2) without approval from the 
Medical Monitor may be required to permanently discontinue study treatment and withdraw 
from the study. If specific medical conditions necessitate the use of any disallowed concomitant 
medications, the Sponsor or Sponsor designee must be contacted for approval. Participants who 
withdraw from the study due to a disallowed concomitant therapy must complete an ET Visit.
For participants who complete the study, permanently discontinue study treatment, or withdraw 
from the study, starting any of these disallowed medications should be based on discretion of the 
treating neurologist, with consideration of the PK/PD profile of the study treatment.
7.7.2. Concomitant Procedures
A concomitant procedure is any therapeutic intervention (e.g., surgery/biopsy, physical therapy) 
or diagnostic assessment (e.g., blood gas measurement, bacterial cultures) performed between 
the time the participant is enrolled in the study and the last study visit. 
Concomitant procedures are allowed in appropriate situations: 
In an emergency situation, concomitant procedures should be reported accordingly. 
In a non-emergency situation, concomitant procedures should be authorized by the 
Investigator in collaboration with the Medical Monitor and approved by the Sponsor.
Any concomitant procedures administered should be recorded.
7.8. Continuation of Treatment 
No further provisions are made for access to the study treatment after the study, and participants 
will continue to receive standard of care at that time. If BIIB091 monotherapy or BIIB091 
combination therapy with DRF is proven to be beneficial, all regulatory requirements regarding 
poststudy access will be met.Protocol 257MS201, Version 2.0

WITHDRAWAL OF PARTICIPANTS FROM THE STUDY
8.1. Discontinuation of Study Treatment
A participant must permanently discontinue study treatment for any of the following reasons:
The participant withdraws consent to continue study treatment. 
The participant becomes pregnant. Study treatment must be discontinued 
immediately. Report the pregnancy according to the instructions in Section 11.4.1.
The participant is not compliant with the study treatment or study procedures.
The Sponsor decides to stop the study prematurely.
The participant experiences a medical emergency that necessitates unblinding of the 
participants treatment assignment.
The Investigator discontinues participant study treatment for medical reasons.
The participant experiences an AE that necessitates permanent discontinuation of 
study treatment.
The participant develops ventricular arrhythmia that requires hospitalization or urgent 
intervention. 
The participant experiences a serious hypersensitivity reaction that may be related to 
study treatment.
The participant has either of the following:
a QTcF > 500 ms or uncorrected QT interval > 600 ms
a confirmed increase in QTcF of > 60 ms from Baseline
The participant is diagnosed with acute pancreatitis.
The participant is diagnosed with PML.
The primary reason for discontinuation of study treatment must be recorded in the participants 
CRF.
Participants who discontinue treatment must remain in the study and continue protocol-required 
tests and assessments, where possible. Protocol 257MS201, Version 2.0

CONFIDENTIAL
The information contained herein may not be used, disclosed, or published without the written consent of 
Biogen MA Inc.
828.2. Temporary Withholding Criteria
If the participant experiences a serious infection other than PML, study treatment is withheld for 
a maximum of 4 weeks until the serious infection has resolved, as determined by the 
Investigator, otherwise, study treatment will be permanently discontinued. Participants who 
recover from serious or opportunistic infections with prophylaxis measures may resume 
treatment at the discretion of the Sponsor, in concordance with the Investigator and the Medical 
Monitor.
Study treatment must also be temporarily withheld if any of the following laboratory parameters 
meet the threshold limits described below:
AST or ALT > 3  ULN. Study treatment must be withheld, and liver function (ALT, 
AST, alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin) must be retested within 48 to 72 hours 
for confirmation. Study treatment will be permanently discontinued for an individual 
participant if any of the following criteria are met:
AST or ALT  3  ULN and (total bilirubin level > 2  ULN or INR > 1.5)
AST or ALT > 3  ULN for  4 weeks after withholding of study treatment
AST or ALT > 5  ULN for more than 2 weeks after withholding of study 
treatment
AST or ALT  8  ULN
AST or ALT > 3  ULN associated with the appearance or worsening of rash or 
hepatitis symptoms (i.e., fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant pain or 
tenderness, fever, rash, and/or eosinophilia).
If study treatment is permanently discontinued because of liver abnormalities, the 
event will be appropriately investigated to determine the potential cause. 
eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, confirmed by repeat testing as soon as possible. If the 
eGFR remains < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 for  4 weeks after withholding study treatment, 
the participant must permanently discontinue study treatment.
ALC < 0.5  109/L, confirmed by repeat testing as soon as possible. If the value 
remains < 0.5  109/L for  6 months, the participant must permanently discontinue 
study treatment. Participants who completed the study with a last measured 
lymphocyte count < 0.8  103/L will require additional follow-up approximately 
every 8 weeks to monitor their lymphocyte counts until their ALC > LLN, or for a 
period up to 6 months, or until they commence another disease-modifying therapy, 
whichever occurs first.
Neutrophil count < 500/mm3 (Grade 4) or neutrophil count 500 to 999/mm3 (Grade 3) 
with fever, confirmed by repeat testing. Study treatment must be withheld if the result Protocol 257MS201, Version 2.0

83is confirmed upon retest within 48 hours. If the value remains < 999/mm3 for 
 4 weeks after withholding study treatment, then the participant must permanently 
discontinue study treatment and the event must be recorded as an AE.
Platelet count < 25,000/mm3 (Grade 4) or platelet count 25,000 to 49,999/mm3 
(Grade 3) with bleeding, confirmed by repeat testing. Study treatment must be 
withheld if the result is confirmed upon retest within 48 hours. If the value remains 
< 49,999/mm3 for  4 weeks after withholding study treatment, then the participant 
must permanently discontinue study treatment, and the event must be recorded as an 
AE.
Urine albumin-to-urine creatinine ratio > 200 mg/g (22.6 mg/mmol), confirmed by 
repeat testing within 7 days. If the urine albumin-to-urine creatinine ratio remains 
> 200 mg/g (22.6 mg/mmol) for  4 weeks after withholding study treatment, the 
participant must permanently discontinue study treatment.
After Week 16, study treatment may be temporarily suspended for a maximum of 
21 days after administration of COVID-19 vaccine for the vaccine to exert its effect.
8.3. Lost to Follow-Up
Participants will be considered lost to follow-up if they repeatedly fail to return for scheduled 
visits and are unable to be contacted by the study site. 
The following actions must be taken if a participant fails to return to the study site for a required 
study visit:
The site must attempt to contact the participant and reschedule the missed visit as 
soon as possible, and counsel the participant on the importance of maintaining the 
assigned visit schedule and ascertain whether the participant wishes to and/or should 
continue in the study.
In cases in which the participant is deemed lost to follow-up, the Investigator or 
designee must make every effort to regain contact with the participant. These contact 
attempts should be documented in the participants medical record.
Should the participant continue to be unreachable, that participant will be considered to have 
withdrawn from the study with a primary reason of lost to follow-up.
8.4. Withdrawal of Participants From the Study
Participants must be withdrawn from the study for any one of the following reasons:
The participant withdraws consent for participation in the study. Protocol 257MS201, Version 2.0

84The participant enrolls into another interventional clinical study in which an 
investigational treatment or approved therapy for investigational use is administered.
The participant is unwilling or unable to comply with the protocol.
The primary reason for the participants withdrawal from the study must be recorded in the 
participants CRF.
Participants should undergo an ET Visit unless withdrawal is due to death or withdrawal of 
consent.

859. EFFICACY, PHARMACOKINETIC, AND 
PHARMACODYNAMIC ASSESSMENTS
See Section 1.3 for the timing of all assessments.
Tests and evaluations affecting primary endpoints and/or analyses may need to be repeated if the 
original results are lost or damaged. In these cases, participants will be asked to return to the 
study site to have the evaluations repeated.
9.1. Efficacy Assessments
9.1.1. Brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging
MRI scans will be assessed according to the Schedule of Activities (see Table 1).
Brain MRI scans will be performed according to a standardized imaging protocol before and 
after the administration of single-dose Gd. Images will be assessed and reported by an 
independent, blinded, centralized MRI vendor. Further details, including the scans required and 
the optimal MRI workflow, will be provided in a separate Imaging Manual.
Brain MRI measurements include, but are not limited to, the following:
T1-weighted MRI before Gd infusion
T1-weighted MRI after Gd infusion
T2-weighted MRI 
susceptibility-weighted MRI (if available at site)
The cumulative number of new T1 GdE brain lesions, the cumulative number of new or 
enlarging T2 lesions, and the cumulative volume of new or enlarging T2 hyperintense lesions 
will be collected and reported. Number of GdE lesions at each visit, numbers and volumes of 
new unenhancing T1 hypointense lesions that persist for  24 weeks, normalized T1-weighted 
intensity in unenhancing T1 hypointense lesions, SEL-related outcomes (including number and 
volume and normalized T1-weighted intensity and unenhancing T1 lesion volume), number of 
new and disappearing PRLs, tissue characteristics of PRLs, tissue compartment, and regional 
brain volume may be collected and reported. Additional lesion types may be studied by machine 
learning/artificial intelligence, and analyses of the number and volume of lesions may be 
collected and reported as exploratory endpoints.
SELs are a longitudinal MRI measure of disease. SELs are identified as pre-existing 
T2-weighted hyperintense lesions that slowly expand over time using deformation-based 
analyses that simultaneously use the T1-weighted and T2-weighted scans [ Elliott 2018]. 
The reported volume of SELs is the baseline volume of lesions detected as SELs at various 
postbaseline timepoints.Protocol 257MS201, Version 2.0

86PRLs are identified by a conspicuous rim around the lesion as seen on susceptibility-weighted 
MRI. The paramagnetic rim is generally reflective of accumulating iron-laden 
macrophages/activated microglia associated with chronic inflammation at the lesion edge. 
PRLs are thus considered a putative measure of chronic active lesions.
If the start of a treatment for a relapse with high-dose corticosteroids falls within 7 days of the 
next scheduled visit, every attempt should be made to obtain the MRI before administration of 
the first dose of high-dose corticosteroids. If outside the visit window, the visit should be 
recorded as unscheduled. The MRI at an unscheduled visit prior to steroid treatment must be 
 21 days after the prior MRI. However, if an MRI at an unscheduled visit is < 21 days after a 
prior MRI, then the use of Gd should be strongly avoided, unless determined by the Investigator 
to be clinically indicated. In this scenario, the next regularly scheduled MRI should also be 
obtained. 
9.1.2. Clinical Efficacy Assessments
The following clinical assessments will be performed to evaluate the efficacy of BIIB091 in all 
study participants:
MS relapses (see Section 5.3 )
EDSS
T25FW
9HPT: 9HPT-D and 9HPT-ND (both the right and left hands are tested, with the D 
hand tested before the ND hand)
SDMT
LCLA [ Balcer 2017]
9.1.3. Patient-Reported Outcomes
PRO questionnaires must be completed under the supervision of the primary treating nurse or 
study coordinator during clinical visits before objective test performance is tested. Refer to the 
Study Reference Guide for additional instructions. The following PROs will be collected to 
evaluate the efficacy of BIIB091 in all study participants:
PROMIS-29 profile
FSMC [ Penner 2009]
9.1.4. Digital Outcome Measure
The current study will explore a wide range of digital smartphone-based disease outcome 
assessments derived from remote at-home monitoring assessments, including electronic PROs Protocol 257MS201, Version 2.0

87that may collect self-assessments of mood and quality of life; performance-based outcomes from 
a battery of active tests evaluating cognition (information processing speed), upper extremity 
function, and ambulation; and participants walk step counts and variance in overall mobility 
features (devoid of absolute geolocation information) recorded passively. The smartphone 
application is called Konectom.
Konectom has received CE mark certification in the EU and remains an NSR investigational 
device in the US. In Canada, Konectom is classified as Medical Device Exempt (see the 
Konectom IB for details). 
Data recorded through the application will not be used to determine patient care. Any digitally 
collected outcomes will only be exploratory.
9.1.4.1. Konectom 
Konectom is an at-home (and in-clinic) smartphone-based application intended to be used as a 
self-assessment tool to objectively quantify motor and cognitive function and their impairments 
associated with MS.
Continuous sensor-based passive mobility data is also collected.
Where local regulations and ethics committee approval allow, smartphone-based digital 
assessments will be completed by all participants, both in-clinic during scheduled study visits 
and remotely (at-home tests). Digital assessments include tests evaluating motor and cognitive 
functions that are enabled on consumer mobile devices that are provided to participants. At-home 
tests will be requested daily for the first-week post-Baseline (Day 1) and weekly for the 
remainder of the trial. At-home tests will not be requested for weeks with in-clinic Konectom 
administration.
Additional details on the use of Konectom to perform digital assessments will be provided in the 
Instruction for Use.
Details for the collection of complaints about the device and ADEs are provided in 
Section 11.5.3.
The Konectom assessments include ambulation tests, fine motor tests, cognition tests, and PROs. Protocol 257MS201, Version 2.0

88Ambulation Tests 
6MWT: to evaluate walking performance, fatigability, and limitations in walking 
distance
UTT: to evaluate gait and balance while turning
SBT: to evaluate static balance
Fine Motor Tests 
Drawing Test: clinical study participants will be asked to draw a set of shapes on the 
smartphone touchscreen. Upper extremity function will be evaluated.
Pinching Test: to evaluate grasping and dexterity. The participant will be asked to 
pinch as many of the randomly displayed circular shapes as possible over 30 seconds.
Cognition Test 
CPST (based on previously clinically validated SDMT): clinical study participants 
will be asked to complete a series of cognitive tasks (e.g., matching symbols to 
numbers) within a fixed period of time. Cognitive performance speed will be 
evaluated.
Patient-Reported Outcome
Mood questionnaires: clinical study participants will be asked to self-report their 
emotional and physical states. 
MSIS-29 v2 physical and psychological scores.
9.2. Pharmacokinetic Assessments
Sparse PK sampling will be conducted to measure plasma BIIB091, MMF, and HES 
concentrations at predetermined timepoints, and intensive PK sampling post-steady state will be 
conducted at Week 4, as provided in the Schedule of Activities ( Table 1). The PK sampling 
timepoints for BIIB091, MMF, and HES are -15 minutes (predose) and 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 hours 
(postdose; relative to the first BID [morning dose]) administered on that day ( Table 2). 
PK will be assessed as C max measured postdose and C trough measured predose at specific 
timepoints. PopPK, PK/PD, and C-QT analyses, if conducted, will be reported separately.Protocol 257MS201, Version 2.0

899.3. Pharmacodynamic Assessments
The PD properties of BIIB091 monotherapy or BIIB091 in combination with DRF will be 
evaluated using assessments that include, but may not be limited to, the following: 
Serum and whole blood will be collected for potential biomarkers related to MS or 
evaluated as treatment response biomarkers in response to BIIB091 or DRF at the 
Sponsors discretion. 
The PD properties of BIIB091 and DRF will be evaluated using assessments that 
include, but may not be limited to, the following:
changes in immune cell subsets (TBNK)
B-cell activation (CD69 expression)
Disease activity biomarkers include, but may not be limited to, the following 
biomarker associated with the disease MS: 
serum NfL levels 
9.4. Pharmacogenetic and Genetic Assessments
Where local regulations and ethics committee approval allows and if the participant accepts, a 
DNA sample will be collected for future exploratory genetic analysis related to MS and/or the 
response to BIIB091 or DRF. This one-time required blood collection is listed in the Schedule of 
Activities. In addition, where allowed by local, regional, and national regulatory authorities and 
ethics committees, participants will be offered the option for residual DNA samples to be 
retained for future exploratory unspecified genetic research that may be used to understand the 
biology of other diseases and traits of interest to the Sponsor and/or to develop diagnostic and 
analytical tests. Participants who consent to their samples being retained for future genetic 
research will be required to sign a separate, written pharmacogenomics ICF.
Genetic polymorphism in genes encoding drug targets or the downstream pathways, as well as 
proteins that impact drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination, may affect the 
safety and efficacy of the study treatment.
In the event of an unusual response or observation of unexplained AEs, DNA samples may be 
used to determine if there are any pharmacogenetic associations with drug response. 
In the future, as the understanding of MS and/or BIIB091 or DRF increases, additional genetic 
analyses may be warranted to refine the knowledge of the molecular basis of the disease and the 
drug response and to advance the development of novel therapeutics.
The DNA samples will be coded with the participants identification number and stored for up to 
25 years after the end of the main study years or a duration dictated by local, national, or regional 
laws or regulations. No genotyping or genetic data will be provided to the participant. Protocol 257MS201, Version 2.0

Biogen MA Inc.
90Participants may withdraw consent and request to have their sample destroyed at any time and no 
further genetic data will be generated; any data already generated will not be destroyed.
9.5. Future Scientific Research Assessments
Where allowed by local, regional, and national regulatory authorities and ethics committees, 
participants will be offered the option for residual serum samples to be retained for future, 
unspecified, exploratory biomarker analysis. In addition, MRI scans may be stored for future 
analysis. Participants who opt for samples and scans to be retained for such use will be required 
to sign a separate, written Future Scientific Research ICF.
The samples may be utilized to identify or verify putative, prognostic, and predictive markers 
associated with disease and markers of therapeutic response to treatment and/or to develop 
diagnostic and analytical tests. Background and dynamic clinical disease characteristics and 
associated biomarker data may be utilized to predict subsequent disease worsening (severity), 
identify high-risk patient subgroups, and identify predictors of response to treatment.
Serum will be collected and stored for future exploratory analyses to measure proteins of interest 
related to MS disease, BIIB091, and/or DRF treatment response. DNA samples may be collected 
for any future exploratory genomics analyses (Section 9.4). The collected samples will be tested 
at the Sponsors discretion.
The serum samples will be coded with the participants identification number (but are otherwise 
anonymized) and stored for 15 years or a duration dictated by local, national, or regional laws or 
regulations. Participants may withdraw consent and request to have their sample destroyed at any 
time and no further data will be generated; any data already generated will not be destroyed.Protocol 257MS201, Version 2.0

9311. SAFETY DEFINITIONS, RECORDING, REPORTING, AND 
RESPONSIBILITIES
Throughout the course of the study, every effort must be made to remain alert to possible AEs 
and ADEs. If an AE or ADE occurs, the first concern should be for the safety of the participant. 
If necessary, appropriate medical intervention should be provided.
At the signing of the ICF, each participant and/or their legally authorized representative must be 
given the names and telephone numbers of site staff for reporting SAEs, UADEs, pregnancies, 
overdoses, and medical emergencies. Throughout the protocol, the Sponsor is named, but 
reporting may be done through a CRO.
Konectom is classified as a Medical Device in EU, carrying the CE mark. Therefore, in 
European countries, AEs and product complaints will be handled according to the Sponsors 
technical product complaint management process and reported according to standard local 
postmarketing channels. For the classification of Konectom in other countries, refer to the 
Konectom IB.
11.1. Definitions
11.1.1. Adverse Event
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject 
(participant) administered a pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily have a causal 
relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(including an abnormal assessment such as an abnormal laboratory value), symptom, or disease 
temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product or auxiliary medicinal 
products defined in Section 7.3.4, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) 
product or auxiliary medicinal product.
Determination of whether an abnormal assessment (e.g., laboratory value, vital sign, and ECG) 
result meets the definition of an AE will be made by the Investigator. Abnormal results are not 
considered AEs unless one or more of the following criteria are met:
The result meets the criteria for an SAE.
The result requires the participant to receive specific corrective therapy.
The result is considered by the Investigator to be clinically significant.
11.1.2. Serious Adverse Event
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:
Results in death.Protocol 257MS201, Version 2.0
Phase 2 Study to Evaluate BIIB091 Monotherapy and BIIB091 Combination Therapy in RMS
CONFIDENTIAL
The information contained herein may not be used, disclosed, or published without the written consent of 
Biogen MA Inc.
94In the view of the Investigator, places the participant at immediate risk of death (a 
life-threatening event); however, this does not include an event that, had it occurred 
in a more severe form, might have caused death.
Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization.
Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity.
Results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect.
Is a medically important event.
A medically important event is an AE that, in the opinion of the Investigator, may jeopardize the 
participant or may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the 
definition above. (Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring 
intensive treatment in an emergency room or convulsions occurring at home that do not require 
an inpatient hospitalization.)
11.1.3. Prescheduled or Elective Procedures or Routinely Scheduled Treatments
A prescheduled or elective procedure or a routinely scheduled treatment will not be considered 
an SAE, even if the participant is hospitalized. The study site must document all the following:
The prescheduled or elective procedure or routinely scheduled treatment was 
scheduled (or was on a waiting list to be scheduled) prior to obtaining the 
participants consent to be in the study.
The condition requiring the prescheduled or elective procedure or routinely scheduled 
treatment was present before and did not worsen or progress in the opinion of the 
Investigator between the participants consent to be in the study and the time of the 
procedure or treatment.
The prescheduled or elective procedure or routinely scheduled treatment is the sole 
reason for the intervention or hospital admission.
oIf a participant is hospitalized due to local requirements for administration of 
the study treatment, the hospitalization should not be considered an SAE 
unless one of the requirements in Section 11.1.2 is met.
11.2. Safety Classifications
11.2.1. Investigator Assessment of Events
All events must be assessed to determine the following:
If the event meets the criteria for an SAE as defined in Section 11.1.2.Protocol 257MS201, Version 2.0
Phase 2 Study to Evaluate BIIB091 Monotherapy and BIIB091 Combination Therapy in RMS
CONFIDENTIAL
The information contained herein may not be used, disclosed, or published without the written consent of

95The relationship of the event to study treatment and/or auxiliary medicinal product, as 
defined in Section 11.2.2. 
The severity of the event as defined in Section 11.2.3.
11.2.2. Relationship of Events to Study Treatment and/or Auxiliary Medicinal Products
The following definitions should be considered when evaluating the relationship of AEs and 
SAEs to the study treatment and/or auxiliary medicinal products. Definitions for auxiliary 
medicinal products are provided in Section 7.3.4.
Relationship of Event to Study Treatment and/or Auxiliary Medicinal Product(s)
Not related An AE will be considered not related to the use of the investigational product or 
auxiliary medicinal product if there is not a reasonable possibility that the event has 
been caused by the product. Factors pointing toward this assessment include, but are 
not limited to, the lack of reasonable temporal relationship between administration of 
the investigational product or auxiliary medicinal product and the AE, the presence of a 
biologically implausible relationship between the product and the AE, or the presence 
of a more likely alternative explanation for the AE.
Related An AE will be considered related to the use of the investigational product or 
auxiliary medicinal product if there is a reasonable possibility that the event may have 
been caused by the product. Factors that point toward this assessment include, but are 
not limited to, a positive rechallenge, a reasonable temporal sequence between 
administration of the investigational product or auxiliary medicinal product and the AE, 
a known response pattern of the suspected product, improvement following 
discontinuation or dose reduction, a biologically plausible relationship between the 
product and the AE, or a lack of an alternative explanation for the AE.
11.2.3. Severity of Events
The severity of AEs and SAEs will be graded using the National Cancer Institute CTCAE, 
version 5.0. Any AE not listed in the CTCAE will be graded as follows:
Severity of Event
Grade Definition
1Mild AE (asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated)
2Moderate AE (minimal, local, or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting 
age-appropriate instrumental activities of daily living)
3Severe or medically significant AE (not immediately life-threatening; hospitalization or 
prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self-care activities of daily 
living)
4 Life-threatening AE (urgent intervention indicated)

9611.2.4. Expectedness of Events
Expectedness of all SAEs will be determined by the Sponsor as follows:
For study treatment, according to the BIIB091 IB and the DRF IB, as applicable.
For authorized auxiliary medicinal products Gd-based contrast agents/media (ATC 
code: V08CA) and IVMP, according to the SmPC/USPI/local label, as applicable. 
These products are defined in Section 7.3.4. 
11.3. Monitoring and Recording Events
11.3.1. Adverse Events
Investigators are responsible for eliciting AEs experienced by participants as per the study 
design/schedule of activities. Any AE experienced by the participant between the time of first 
dose of study treatment (BIIB091, DRF, or both) and/or auxiliary medicinal product and the 
participants EOS date is to be recorded on the CRF, regardless of the severity of the event or its 
relationship to study treatment and/or auxiliary medicinal product. At each study visit, the 
Investigator will assess the participant for AEs and will record any new AEs or updates to 
previously reported AEs on the CRF. 
AEs that are ongoing when the participant completes or discontinues the study will be followed 
by the Investigator until the event has resolved, stabilized, or returned to baseline status. AE 
outcome will be recorded on the CRF, as applicable.
11.3.2. Adverse Events of Special Interest
An AESI is an AE of scientific and medical concern specific to this study, for which ongoing 
monitoring and reporting to the Sponsor within 24 hours are required.
Events considered AESIs for BIIB091 will include the following events:
QT prolongation (based on the average of triplicate QTcF measured at the same 
timepoint) that is considered to be clinically significant (change from baseline 
> 60 ms and/or QTc > 500 ms)
ventricular tachyarrhythmia
hepatic events
The following laboratory criteria will be considered evidence of a hepatic event AESI:

Hepatic events included as AESIs of BIIB091 were not based on current knowledge of BIIB091, 
but were based on emerging data from other BTK inhibitors in development.
Events considered AESIs for DRF will include the following events:
PML and all related terms according to MedDRA
Pancreatitis and all related terms according to MedDRA
All cases (serious and nonserious) of PML, pancreatitis, hepatic event AESI, ventricular 
tachyarrhythmia, and clinically significant QT prolongation (change from baseline > 60 ms 
and/or QTc >500 ms) should be reported to the Sponsors safety group on the AESI form within 
24 hours of the site staff becoming aware of the AESI and recorded in the participants CRF.
11.3.3. Serious Adverse Events
Any SAE experienced by the participant between the time of the signing of the ICF and the 
participants EOS date is to be recorded on an SAE form and recorded in the participants CRF, 
regardless of the severity of the event or its relationship to study treatment and/or auxiliary 
medicinal product. Thereafter, the event should be reported to the Sponsor only if the 
Investigator considers the SAE to be related to study treatment.
SAEs must be reported to the Sponsor within 24 hours (as described in Section 11.3.4 or 
according to national law). Follow-up information regarding an SAE also must be reported 
within 24 hours. 
An SAE that is also an AESI is to be reported per Section 11.3.4. 
Any SAE that is ongoing when the participant completes or discontinues the study will be 
followed by the Investigator until the event has resolved, stabilized, or returned to baseline 
status. 
11.3.4. Immediate Reporting of Serious Adverse Events and Adverse Events of Special 
Interest
In order to adhere to all applicable laws and regulations for reporting an SAE and AESIs, the 
study site must formally notify the Sponsor within 24 hours of the site staff becoming aware of 
the SAE or AESI, or according to national law. It is the Investigators responsibility to ensure 
that the SAE and AESI reporting information and procedures are used and followed 
appropriately.
Reporting Information for SAEs and AESIs
A report must be submitted to the Sponsor regardless of the following:Protocol 257MS201, Version 2.0

To report initial or follow-up information on an SAE or AESI, fax or email the respective 
completed form; refer to the Study Reference Guides Official Study Contact List for complete 
contact information.
11.3.5. Deaths
Death is an outcome of an event. The event that resulted in death should be recorded on the 
appropriate CRF. All causes of death must be reported as SAEs within 24 hours of the site 
becoming aware of the event or according to national law. The Investigator should make every 
effort to obtain and send death certificates and autopsy reports to the Sponsor. The term death 
should be reported as an SAE only if the cause of death is not known and cannot be determined.
11.3.6. Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions
SUSARs are SAEs that are unexpected and judged by the Investigator or the Sponsor to be 
related to the study treatment administered.
Appropriate personnel at the Sponsor will unblind SUSARs for the purpose of regulatory 
reporting. The Sponsor will submit SUSARs (in blinded or unblinded fashion) to regulatory 
agencies according to local law. The Sponsor will submit SUSARs to Investigators in a blinded 
fashion.Procedures for Handling Special Situations
11.4.1. Public Health Emergency Due to the SARS-Cov-2 Pandemic
In the event that a public health emergency due to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic results in study 
site closure, travel restrictions, and/or the study being deprioritized at the site such that clinic 
visit(s) cannot occur, applicable local guidances on clinical trials during the SARS-CoV-2 
pandemic within each country or region should be followed, for example the EU Guidance 
[EMA 2022]. A protocol deviation would be incurred for any deviation from the protocol-
specified visits and assessments, with the additional notation that this protocol deviation is due to 
the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
If a protocol-specified clinical visit cannot occur due to a SARS-CoV-2 pandemic-related public 
health emergency, the following mitigating options should be pursued, in order of preference (in 
which the highest preference option that is feasible should be done): 1) transfer to another active 
study site that is open, 2) home visit, 3) telemedicine visit (e.g., by telephone or web conference), 
and 4) local laboratory visit. These mitigating options only apply in the setting of a SARS-CoV-2 
pandemic-related public health emergency in which a protocol-specified clinic visit cannot occur Protocol 257MS201, Version 2.0
Phase 2 Study to Evaluate BIIB091 Monotherapy and BIIB091 Combination Therapy in RMS
CONFIDENTIAL
The information contained herein may not be used, disclosed, or published without the written consent of 
Biogen MA Inc.
99and should not be pursued solely due to the participants preference. If the participant does not 
participate in one of these options, a Safety Telephone call must be conducted within 14 days of 
the scheduled visit that is impacted.
Details on which visits and procedures are eligible to be performed at alternative medical 
facilities will be provided by the Sponsor in writing. All procedures performed at alternative 
medical facilities will need to be performed as described in this protocol, and medical staff will 
need to be trained accordingly. 
The Sponsor will determine appropriate start and end dates for each contingency measure, where 
the duration of the mitigations may begin at the onset of site restrictions for a specific site and/or 
country and may end once those restrictions are lifted and in accordance with local laws and 
regulations. The adaptations to the visits and procedures described are alternatives or deviations 
to the main protocol procedures.
These contingency measures will only be implemented in exceptional cases and after the site has 
received written notification from the Sponsor. In situations where written notification may be 
delayed, alternate communications (e.g., telephone) may be used until written notification is 
available. The Sponsor will have the final authority to decide what mitigations can be 
implemented, in accordance with local laws and regulations.
The Sponsor will communicate decisions to the Principal Investigator(s) and study site(s) via 
protocol clarification letters. The protocol clarification letter will include details such as which 
visits are eligible to be conducted via televisits. Study sites will be responsible for notifying any 
required boards or committees.
11.4.2. Pregnancy
Participants should not become pregnant or impregnate their partners during the study 
and for 90 days after their last dose of study treatment. If a female participant becomes 
pregnant, study treatment must be discontinued immediately.
The Investigator must report a pregnancy occurring in a female participant and/or female partner 
of a male participant from first dose of study treatment to 90 days after their last dose of study 
treatment by faxing or emailing the pregnancy form to the Sponsor within 24 hours of the site 
staff becoming aware of the pregnancy. Refer to the Study Reference Guides Official Study 
Contact List for complete contact information. The Investigator or site staff must report the 
outcome of the pregnancy to the Sponsor. A pregnancy is not considered an AE and should not 
be recorded on the AE CRF. 
If awareness of a pregnancy occurs after the participant completed the EOS Visit, the 
Investigator should report pregnancies where conception occurred during the study treatment 
period or within 90 days from their last dose of study treatment. 
Every reasonable effort will be made by the Investigator to follow up the pregnancy of a female 
subject or a consented female partner until delivery. A pregnancy notification form and follow-Protocol 257MS201, Version 2.0

100up will be completed. The Investigator or site staff must report the outcome of the pregnancy to 
the Sponsor.
Congenital abnormalities and birth defects in the offspring of male or female participants should 
be reported as an SAE if conception occurred during the study treatment period or within 5 times 
the half-life or 90 days from their last dose of study treatment, whichever is longer.
11.4.3. Overdose
An overdose is any dose of study treatment administered to a participant or taken by a participant 
that exceeds the dose assigned to the participant according to the protocol. Overdoses are not 
considered AEs and should not be recorded as an AE on the CRF; however, all overdoses must 
be recorded in an Overdose form and faxed or emailed to the Sponsor within 24 hours of the site 
becoming aware of the overdose. An overdose must be reported to the Sponsor even if the 
overdose does not result in an AE. If an overdose results in an AE, the AE must be recorded. If 
an overdose results in an SAE, both the SAE and Overdose forms must be completed and faxed 
or emailed to the Sponsor. All study treatment-related dosing information must be recorded in 
the dosing CRF.
11.4.4. Abuse, Misuse, Medication Error, and Accidental or Occupational Exposure
Abuse, misuse, medication error, and accidental or occupational exposure events (defined below) 
are not considered AEs and should not be recorded as an AE on the CRF; however, all 
occurrences of abuse, misuse, medication error, and accidental or occupational exposure with 
any study treatment and/or unauthorized auxiliary medicinal product administered must be 
recorded on a Clinical Trial Special Situation(s) Report form and faxed or emailed to the 
Sponsor within 24 hours of the site becoming aware of the event. Abuse, misuse, medication 
error, and accidental or occupational exposure must be reported to the Sponsor from first dose of 
study treatment and/or auxiliary medicinal product to last study visit, even if the event does not 
result in an AE. If an abuse, misuse, medication error, or accidental or occupational exposure 
event results in an AE, the AE must be recorded on the CRF. If an abuse, misuse, medication 
error, or accidental or occupational exposure event results in an SAE, both the SAE and the 
Clinical Trial Special Situation(s) Report forms must be completed and faxed or emailed to the 
Sponsor within 24 hours of awareness. All study treatment-related dosing information must be 
recorded on the dosing CRF.
These events are defined as follows:
Abuse: persistent or sporadic, intentional excessive use of the study treatment and/or 
auxiliary medicinal product that is accompanied by harmful physical or psychological 
effects.
Misuse: medicinal product is intentionally and inappropriately used not in accordance 
with the authorized/approved product information.Protocol 257MS201, Version 2.0

101Medication error: any preventable incident that may cause or lead to inappropriate 
study treatment and/or auxiliary medicinal product use or participant harm while the 
product is in the control of the health care professionals or participants. Such incident 
may be due to health care professional practice, product labeling, packaging and 
preparation, procedures for administration, and systems, including the following: 
prescribing, order communication, nomenclature, compounding, dispensing, 
distribution, administration, education, monitoring, and use.
Accidental/occupational exposure: the unintentional exposure to a study treatment 
and/or auxiliary medicinal product as a result of ones professional or nonprofessional 
occupation, or accidental exposure to a nonprofessional to whom exposure was not 
intended (i.e., product given to wrong participant).
11.4.5. Medical Emergency
In a medical emergency requiring immediate attention, the site staff will apply appropriate 
medical intervention, according to current standards of care. The Investigator (or designee) 
should contact the studys Medical Director. Refer to the Study Reference Guides Official Study 
Contact List for complete contact information.
11.4.5.1. Unblinding for Medical Emergency
In this study, treatment assignment information is provided electronically and will be accessible 
by the Investigator (or designee) in case of a medical emergency where knowledge of a 
participants treatment assignment may influence that participants clinical care. If such an event 
occurs, the date and the reasons for opening the code-break file must be submitted to the Sponsor 
within 24 hours of the unblinding. All treatment assignment information, including electronic or 
hard copies, must be kept in a secure location with limited access.
The Investigator must document the reasons for unblinding in the participants source 
documents. The Investigator is strongly advised not to divulge the participants treatment 
assignment to any individual not directly involved in managing the medical emergency, or to 
personnel involved with the analysis and conduct of the study. The Investigator can contact the 
Sponsor to discuss such situations.
11.5. Device Definition and Reporting Requirements
Follow this section for reporting events during the use of Konectom.
11.5.1. Adverse Device Effect
An ADE is defined as any AE related to the use of an investigational medical device.

CONFIDENTIAL
The information contained herein may not be used, disclosed, or published without the written consent of 
Biogen MA Inc.
10211.5.2. Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect
A UADE is defined as any serious adverse effect on health or safety or any life-threatening 
problem or death caused by or associated with a device if that effect, problem, or death was not 
previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the investigational plan or 
application, or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to 
the rights, safety, or welfare of participants.
The criteria for seriousness include the following:
requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization
causes disability or permanent damage
results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity
requires intervention to prevent permanent impairment/damage
results in congenital anomaly/birth defect
any other medically important event that, in the opinion of the Investigator, may 
jeopardize the participant or may require intervention to prevent one of the other 
outcomes listed in the definition above
Any UADE experienced by a participant after the participant signs the ICF and before study 
completion or premature study withdrawal is to be recorded on the AE eCRF and on a Clinical 
Trial Device Reporting Form and faxed or emailed to the Sponsor within 24 hours of the site 
staff becoming aware of the UADE; refer to the Study Reference Guides Official Study Contact 
List for complete contact information. Follow-up information regarding a UADE must be 
reported on the AE CRF and on the Clinical Trial Device Reporting Follow-up Form. 
Additionally, in the US, the study site must formally notify the IRB/ethics committee of UADEs 
within 10 working days of the site staff becoming aware of the UADE.
Participants will be followed for all UADEs until the study completion or premature study 
withdrawal. Any UADE that is ongoing when the participant completes or discontinues the study 
will be followed by the Investigator until the event has resolved, stabilized, or returned to 
baseline status.
11.5.3. Product Complaints
For information on product complaints/device deficiencies related to Konectom, please refer to 
the Konectom IB.
11.5.4. Relationship of Device Effects to Konectom 
The following should be considered when evaluating if an effect is caused by or associated with 
Konectom:Protocol 257MS201, Version 2.0
Phase 2 Study to Evaluate BIIB091 Monotherapy and BIIB091 Combination Therapy in RMS
CONFIDENTIAL
The information contained herein may not be used, disclosed, or published without the written consent of 
Biogen MA Inc.
103The event has a temporal relationship with investigational device use/application or 
procedures.
The event involves a body site or organ that:
the investigational device or procedures are applied to
the investigational device or procedures have an effect on
The serious event follows a known response pattern to the medical device (if the 
response pattern is previously known).
Discontinuation of medical device application (or reduction of the level of 
activation/exposure) and reintroduction of its use (or increase of the level of 
activation/exposure) have an impact on the serious event (when clinically feasible).
Other possible causes (e.g., an underlying or concurrent illness/clinical condition 
and/or an effect of another device, drug, or treatment) have been adequately ruled out.
Harm to the participant is due to an error in use.
In order to establish the relatedness, not all the criteria listed above might be met at the same 
time. Depending on the type of device/procedures and the serious effect, an event may be 
assessed as related even if all the criteria listed above are not met.
11.5.5. Severity of Device Effects
The following definitions should be considered when evaluating the severity of ADEs/UADEs:
Severity of Event
Mild Symptoms barely noticeable to participant or do not make participant uncomfortable; 
does not influence performance or functioning; prescription drug not ordinarily needed 
for relief of symptoms.
Moderate Symptoms of a sufficient severity to make participant uncomfortable; performance of 
daily activity is influenced; participant is able to continue in study; treatment for 
symptoms may be needed.
Severe Symptoms cause severe discomfort; symptoms cause incapacitation or significant 
impact on participants daily life; severity may cause cessation of device use; treatment 
for symptoms may be given and/or participant hospitalized.

10411.6. Contraception Requirements
All WOCBP and all men with WOCBP partners must ensure that highly effective contraception 
is used during the study and for at least 90 days after their last dose of study treatment, unless in 
conflict with local or country rules and guidelines. In addition, participants should not donate 
sperm or eggs for the duration of the study and for at least 90 days after their last dose of study 
treatment.
For the purposes of this study, WOCBP are defined as all women physiologically capable of 
becoming pregnant, UNLESS they meet 1 of the following conditions: 
Postmenopausal

medical cause and a serum FSH level >40 mIU/mL 
o6 weeks after surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without hysterectomy
Posthysterectomy 
Female surgical sterilization (e.g., bilateral tubal ligation), where applicable, according to 
local guidelines
For the purposes of the study, highly effective contraception is defined in agreement with the 
current Clinical Trial Facilitation and Coordination Group guidance [ HMA 2020] as use of one 
of the following and achieves a failure rate of less than 1% when used consistently and correctly. 
For females:
Established use of oral, intravaginal, or transdermal combined (estrogen and progestogen 
containing) hormonal methods of contraception associated with the inhibition of 
ovulation
Established use of oral, injected, or implanted hormonal methods of contraception 
associated with the inhibition of ovulation
Placement of an intrauterine device or intrauterine hormone-releasing system
Bilateral tubal occlusion
Sex with a male who has undergone surgical sterilization (with the appropriate 
postvasectomy documentation of the absence of sperm in the ejaculate)

Sex with a woman who uses the methods described for females if she is of childbearing 
potential
Note: Contraceptives and hormone replacement therapies that are known to prolong QT/QTc 
interval (based on each drugs product label and other available references such as Woosley et al. 
[Woosley 2022]), induce or inhibit CYP3A4 [ FDA 2022], or are OATP1B1 or B3 substrates are 
not permitted. A current comprehensive list of medications, including oral contraceptives, known 
to prolong QT/QTc interval is available in the aforementioned citation.
True abstinence, when this is consistent with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant, 
can be considered an acceptable method of contraception based on the evaluation of the 
Investigator who should also take into consideration the duration of the clinical study (abstinence 
would be required during the study and for 90 days after the last dose of study treatment). 
Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods) and 
withdrawal are not considered acceptable methods of contraception. 
Women who are breastfeeding cannot take part in this study.

10712. STATISTICAL METHODS AND DETERMINATION OF 
SAMPLE SIZE
12.1.  General Considerations
Continuous variables will be summarized using descriptive statistics, including mean, SD, 
median, minimum, and maximum, by treatment group. Categorical variables will be presented 
using frequency distributions by treatment group. The stratification factor of region (Eastern 
Europe vs. Other) will be included in the statistical models for adjustment, unless otherwise 
specified. For stratification, Eastern Europe will include participants from countries such as 
Poland and the Czech Republic. Other covariates, if included in the model, will be specified in 
the respective sections. 
No multiplicity adjustment will be performed for all analyses because of the exploratory nature 
of Phase 2 trials.
12.2. Analysis Sets
The populations of study participants used in the analyses are defined in the following analysis 
sets. For each set, study treatment refers to BIIB091, DRF, or placebo. 
12.2.1. Full Analysis Set 
The FAS includes all randomized participants who receive at least 1 dose of study treatment. In 
analyses performed on the FAS, participants will be analyzed according to their randomized 
treatment assignment regardless of treatment received.
12.2.2. Safety Analysis Set
The Safety Analysis Set includes all randomized participants who have received at least 1 dose 
of study treatment. In analyses performed on the Safety Analysis Set, participants will be 
analyzed according to their actual treatment received.
12.2.3. PK Analysis Set
The PK Analysis Set includes all randomized participants who have received at least 1 dose of 
study treatment and have at least 1 measurable study drug concentration in serum. In analyses 
performed on the PK Analysis Set, participants will be analyzed according to their actual 
treatment received. 
12.2.4. Intensive PK Analysis Set
The Intensive PK Analysis Set includes the subset of randomized participants who have received 
at least 1 dose of study treatment and have at least 1 measurable concentration in serum from the 
intensive PK sampling. In analyses performed on the Intensive PK Analysis Set, the participants Protocol 257MS201, Version 2.0

Biogen MA Inc.
108who are selected as the intensive PK cohort will be analyzed according to their actual treatment 
received.
12.2.5.PD Analysis Set
The PD Analysis Set includes all randomized participants who have received at least 1 dose of 
study treatment and who have a baseline measurement and at least 1 postbaseline measurement 
of the parameter of interest. In analyses performed on the PD Analysis Set, participants will be 
analyzed according to their actual treatment received.
12.3. Methods of Analysis for Efficacy Endpoints
In general, the efficacy endpoints will be summarized using descriptive statistics and will be 
analyzed with appropriate statistical models. Efficacy analyses will be based on participants in 
the FAS population. 
Except for adjusting region, all analysis models will include a relevant baseline factor for the 
specified endpoint as a covariate. For example, it is baseline T1 GdE lesion number for the 
cumulative number of new T1 GdE lesions; baseline T2 lesion volume for the cumulative 
number of new or enlarging T2 lesions; baseline T2 lesion volume for the cumulative volume of 
new or enlarging T2 lesions; baseline relapse rate for ARR and time to first relapse; and baseline 
EDSS, T25W, and 9HPT for ODRS. Other baseline factors that may be added in the models 
include prior anti-CD20 therapy and age. If additional variables are added, they will be 
prespecified in the SAP.
12.3.1. Analysis of the Primary Endpoint (Part 2 Only)
The analysis of the primary endpoint will be performed under the estimand framework described 
in the SAP, where relevant intercurrent events and corresponding handling strategies will be 
specified.
12.3.1.1. Cumulative Number of New T1 GdE Lesions Over Weeks 8, 12, and 16
The cumulative number of new T1 GdE lesions over Weeks 8, 12, and 16 will be analyzed based 
on the negative binomial regression model, with offset given by the log number of available 
scans, adjusted for the baseline number of GdE lesions and region (Eastern Europe vs. Other). 
For stratification, Eastern Europe will include participants from countries such as Poland and the 
Czech Republic. Treatment groups will be included as a fixed-effect factor for the treatment 
comparison of each treatment group versus DRF monotherapy. Details on missing data 
imputation will be provided in the SAP. The same statistical model will be used to evaluate the 
cumulative number of new T1 GdE lesions over Weeks 8, 12, and 16 in Part 1 and in Part 2 
(primary endpoint). Protocol 257MS201, Version 2.0

10912.3.2. Analysis of the Secondary Efficacy Endpoints (Part 1 and Part 2)
12.3.2.1. Cumulative Number of New or Enlarging T2 Lesions
The cumulative number of new or enlarging T2 lesions is derived by summing up the numbers of 
new or enlarging T2 lesions at Weeks 8, 12, and 16. The cumulative number of new or enlarging 
T2 lesions over Weeks 8, 12, and 16 will be analyzed based on the negative binomial regression 
model. The baseline volume of T2 lesions and stratification factor of region will be included as 
covariates.
12.3.2.2. Cumulative Volume of New or Enlarging T2 Hyperintense Lesions
The secondary efficacy endpoint is derived by summing up the volumes of new or enlarging T2 
lesions at Weeks 8, 12, and 16. The cumulative volume of new or enlarging T2 hyperintense 
lesions at Weeks 8, 12, and 16 will be analyzed by using ANCOVA with adjustment for the 
baseline T2 lesion volume and region. If the data are not normally distributed, then the rank 
ANCOVA model will be used. Treatment group will be included as a fixed factor for the 
treatment comparison of each BIIB091 dose to DRF. 
12.3.3. Analysis of Key Exploratory Efficacy Endpoints (Part 1 and Part 2)
For the Part 1 and Part 2 key exploratory efficacy endpoints, the Kaplan-Meier method will be 
used to estimate the proportion of relapsing participants, and a Cox proportional hazards model 
will be used for time-to-event data (e.g., time to relapse, time to confirmed disability 
progression); a mixed-effect repeated measures model will be used for continuous repeatedly 
measured outcomes (e.g., MSIS-29 v2 physical and psychological scores). In general, all models 
will be adjusted for stratification factor for region and relevant baseline measurements (baseline 
relapse rate for time to first relapse, baseline EDSS for progression, baseline MSIS-29 for 
analyses on the MSIS-29 physical, and psychological scores).
12.3.3.1. Annualized Relapse Rate
The analysis of ARR will be based on the relapses that are determined to meet the protocol-
defined definition from Baseline up to the timepoint according to the analysis (or early 
withdrawal). New or recurrent neurological symptoms that occur less than 30 days following the 
onset of the relapse will be considered part of the same relapse. That is, if 2 relapses have onset 
days less than or equal to 30 days of one another, they will be counted as 1 relapse. ARR will be 
analyzed by using a negative binomial regression model with the logarithmic transformation for 
the time on study included as an offset parameter and will be adjusted for baseline relapse rate 
and region.
12.3.3.2. Overall Disability Response Score
The ODRS is a multicomponent score that assesses the overall change in disability over time and 
is derived based on 4 components: EDSS, T25FW, 9HPT-D, and 9HPT-ND. At each visit, each 
component is given a score relative to baseline: -1 (if threshold is met for worsening), 0 
(no changes meet threshold criteria), or +1 (if threshold is met for improvement). The scores of Protocol 257MS201, Version 2.0

110individual assessments are summed up to provide a total ODRS that ranges from +4 to -4 for 
each visit. A mixed-effect repeated measures will be used to analyze the ODRS with adjustment 
for region, and baseline EDSS, T25FW, and 9HPT.
12.3.3.3. Smartphone Digital Outcomes
Due to the innovative nature of smartphone assessments, analyses of the digital clinical outcomes 
are considered exploratory. Details of derived features of the digital outcomes will be specified 
in a priori, separate, digital data processing plan. The prespecified features will be summarized 
and analyzed per the SAP.
12.3.4. Pooled Analysis of Part 1 and Part 2 Efficacy Endpoints
Key efficacy endpoints including T1 GdE lesion number, ARR, and ODRS, will also be 
evaluated after pooling data from Part 1 and Part 2. Analysis models will be similar to those 
specified for the Part 1 and Part 2 analyses, except that the models will include 5 treatment 
groups (BIIB091 low-dose monotherapy, BIIB091 high-dose monotherapy, BIIB091 
selected-dose and DRF low-dose combination therapy, BIIB091 selected-dose and DRF 
standard-dose combination therapy, and DRF standard-dose monotherapy [with the pooled data 
and as reference group for treatment comparison]). Analysis models will be adjusted by region 
and relevant baseline factors for the specified endpoint. Other baseline factors that may be 
included in these models include prior anti-CD20 therapy, age, baseline number of GdE lesions, 
and baseline EDSS.
12.4. Methods of Analysis for Pharmacokinetic Endpoints
Results from the analysis of PK endpoints will be summarized using descriptive statistics by 
treatment group. Details of the additional analyses of PK and exposure-response and 
exposure-safety will be described in a separate analysis plan, and the results of the analyses will 
be documented in a separate report.
12.5. Methods of Analysis for Pharmacodynamic Endpoints
Results from the analysis of PD endpoints will be summarized using descriptive statistics by 
treatment group. Mean change from baseline time profiles for CD69 expression and inhibition 
and absolute count or proportion of immune cell subsets may be plotted on linear and/or 
semi-logarithmic scales. Additional analyses, if any, may be summarized in a separate report.
12.6. Methods of Analysis for Biomarkers/Pharmacogenetics
Results from any unspecified exploratory pharmacogenetic or biomarker research, if performed, 
will be documented separately, and details related to the analyses will not be described in the 
protocol.
Exploratory potential biomarker candidates related to BIIB091 biological activity will be 
summarized using descriptive statistics and will be presented by dose group.Protocol 257MS201, Version 2.0

111Sampling for this analysis will be approved at the discretion of each sites ethics committee. If a 
sites ethics committee does not approve the sampling for the analysis, this section will not be 
applicable to that site.
12.7. Methods of Analysis for Safety Endpoints
The safety endpoints, including AEs, SAEs, and ECGs, will be summarized by treatment group 
using descriptive statistics.
12.7.1. Adverse Events
The incidence of TEAEs and treatment-emergent SAEs are the primary endpoints for safety in 
Part 1 of this study and are also endpoints for safety in Part 2 of the study.
Only TEAEs will be summarized. A TEAE is any new or worsening AE experienced by the 
participant between the time of first dose of study treatment and the participants EOS date 
recorded in the eCRF.
The incidence of all TEAEs and that of all treatment-emergent SAEs will be summarized by 
treatment group, severity, and relationship to study treatment. The summary tables will include 
incidence by system organ class and preferred term, as well as by preferred term only, in 
descending order of frequency. AEs will be coded using MedDRA.
12.7.2. Adverse Device Events
The incidence of ADEs and UADEs are safety endpoints for this study due to the use of 
Konectom. Both will be summarized by treatment group, severity, and relationship to the 
medical device. The summary tables will include incidence by system organ class and preferred 
term, as well as by preferred term only, in descending order of frequency. ADEs will be coded 
using MedDRA.
12.7.3. Clinical Laboratory Results
Clinical laboratory evaluations include hematology, blood chemistry, and urinalysis. Laboratory 
data will be summarized by treatment group and visit using descriptive statistics for both 
recorded values and changes from baseline. Laboratory data will also be summarized using shift 
tables. Shifts from baseline to high/low status for hematology and blood chemistry parameters 
and shifts from baseline to high/positive status for urinalysis will be presented. Summaries of 
laboratory values categorized based on potentially clinically significant abnormalities will be 
provided. Graphical presentations of aggregate data may also be provided for selected 
parameters of interest.
12.7.4. Vital Signs
Vital signs will be summarized by treatment group and visit using descriptive statistics for values 
and changes from baseline. The incidence of clinically relevant abnormalities will also be 
summarized by treatment group.Protocol 257MS201, Version 2.0

112The analysis of vital signs will focus on clinically relevant abnormalities.
The definitions of these clinically relevant abnormalities are shown in Table 3.
Table 3: Criteria Used to Determine Clinically Relevant Abnormalities in Vital Signs
Vital Sign Criteria for Abnormalities
Temperature > 38C or an increase from baseline of at least 1C
Pulse Rate > 100 bpm or an increase from baseline of > 30 bpm
< 40 bpm or a decrease from baseline of > 20 bpm
Systolic
Blood Pressure> 160 mmHg or an increase from baseline of > 40 mmHg
< 90 mmHg or a decrease from baseline of > 30 mmHg
Diastolic
Blood Pressure> 100 mmHg or an increase from baseline of > 30 mmHg
< 45 mmHg or a decrease from baseline of > 20 mmHg
12.7.5. Physical Examinations
Clinically significant abnormal findings on physical examinations will be reported as AEs and 
included in the AE analyses.
12.7.6. Electrocardiograms
The number and percentage of participants with shifts to the categorical values in ECG results 
(abnormal not AE, or abnormal AE) will be summarized by treatment group.
12.7.7. Multiple Sclerosis Signs and Symptoms
Changes from baseline in MS signs and symptoms will be summarized by treatment group.
12.7.8. C-SSRS
C-SSRS data will be summarized using descriptive statistics (number of participants, mean, SD, 
median, minimum, and maximum) for continuous variables and using frequency and percentage 
for discrete variables.
12.8. Planned Analyses
12.8.1. Part 1: Primary and Secondary Endpoint Analysis (Week 16)
An analysis of efficacy, safety, and selected exploratory endpoints will be completed after all 
participants in Part 1 complete Week 16. The overall benefit-risk will be assessed in order to 
determine if the study will proceed to Part 2 and to select a BIIB091 dose for Part 2 
(see Section 14.3 for details). No alpha adjustment will be made. Decision criteria for dose 
selection will be prespecified in the SAP. Protocol 257MS201, Version 2.0

113The participants, site staff, and Sponsor team members responsible for site monitoring and data 
management will remain blinded to treatment assignment during the ongoing data review, as 
well as during the Week 16 analysis in order to minimize the potential for bias in the data 
cleaning process.
12.8.2. Part 2: Primary and Secondary Endpoint Analysis (Week 16)
The primary analysis of the study will be based on data after all participants in Part 2 complete 
the Week 16 Visit. For this analysis of Part 2 data, the reference cohort will be the Part 2 DRF 
monotherapy cohort with approximately 50 randomized participants. Primary and secondary 
efficacy endpoints will be analyzed comparing each combination therapy group to DRF. The 
efficacy superiority of BIIB091 combination therapy to DRF will be examined, by testing if 
statistical significance is in the coefficient estimate of treatment groups in relevant models. 
Safety, PK, PD, and (selected) other efficacy endpoints may also be analyzed in the primary 
analysis. At the end of Part 2, Week 16, selected study management team members will be 
unblinded to complete the analysis (see Section 14.3.1 for details). However, the blind will 
continue to be strictly maintained for all study personnel at sites and for all study participants 
until the end of the study.
12.8.3. Final Analysis
Analyses will be completed at the end of the study, and analyses of efficacy endpoints for this 
final analysis will be considered exploratory.
In general, analysis methods will be the same as those used in the interim analyses of Part 1 and 
Part 2 (mentioned in Section 12.3 to Section 12.7). For example, descriptive statistics by 
treatment groups will be used for the data of safety endpoints and PK/PD endpoints; negative 
binomial models and ANCOVA (or rank-based ANCOVA) will be utilized respectively for 
lesion count-type and volume-type endpoints; mixed-effect repeated measures models will be 
employed for continuous repeatedly measured outcomes (e.g., clinical and PRO measures) and 
associated changes from baseline.
12.9. Sample Size Considerations
The planned sample size is 275 participants.
Accounting for a 12% dropout rate, 275 participants are planned to be enrolled in the study. Of 
these, 125 participants will be randomized in Part 1 and 150 participants will be randomized in 
Part 2. 
In Part 2, a sample size of 50 participants per group (44 evaluable) was designed to detect an 
80% reduction from the mean number (SD) of 1.2 (3) cumulative new T1 GdE lesions over MRI 
scans at Weeks 8, 12, and 16 in the standard dose of DRF monotherapy with approximately 90% 
power and a 10% Type 1 error rate. The sample size of 44 evaluable participants per group was 
derived via negative binomial rate ratio test where the cumulative number of new T1 GdE 
lesions was assumed to follow a negative binomial distribution.Protocol 257MS201, Version 2.0

131APPENDIX 1. SARS-COV-2 CONSIDERATIONS
Because of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, there will be measures taken during the course 
of the study as given below. Where available, PCR testing should be used. Testing may be 
conducted by the central laboratory selected by the Sponsor or locally.
1. At Screening: 
Participants will not be allowed to participate in the study if they have a SARS-CoV-
2 infection within 4 weeks prior to randomization. 
A SARS-CoV-2 PCR test must be done at the Screening Visit and within 14 days 
prior to randomization. A negative test is required at the Screening Visit and within 
14 days of randomization to confirm participant eligibility.
Clinical evidence from non-live COVID-19 vaccine studies showed that highly 
protective immunologic effects are expected within 14 to 21 days after administration 
of the COVID-19 vaccine. Since BIIB091 treatment may reduce the immune response 
to the vaccine if given within 21 days after vaccine administration, it is recommended 
that participants receive the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine 21 days or more prior to 
randomization (for the vaccine to exert its effect), as per local regulation, and/or 
Investigator guidance.
2. At Randomization: Participants will not be allowed to participate in the study in the 
following instances: 
Positive SARS-CoV-2 test (within 14 days prior to randomization); or
Evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection within 4 weeks prior to randomization. 
Symptoms suggestive of SARS-CoV-2 infection, per the judgment of the 
Investigator, may include, but are not limited, to any of the following: 
Fever (temperature > 37.5C or 99.5F), chills, cough, shortness of breath or 
difficulty breathing, fatigue, muscle or body aches, headache, new loss of taste or 
smell, sore throat, congestion or runny nose, nausea or vomiting, or diarrhea. The 
Investigator should assess participants condition holistically when determining 
evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection; or
Close contact with an individual with SARS-CoV-2 infection within 14 days prior to 
randomization, even if vaccinated. Close contact is defined as follows or according to 
local guidance:
Being within 6 feet (1.8 meters) of an infected individual (as confirmed by 
laboratory assessment or clinical diagnosis) for a cumulative total of 15 minutes 
or more over a 24-hour period. Of note, an infected person can spread Protocol 257MS201, Version 2.0

132SARS-CoV-2 starting 2 days before they have any symptoms or, for 
asymptomatic individuals, 2 days before the positive specimen collection date; or 
Other situations as indicated by local risk assessments.
As the pandemic evolves, these instructions may change. Consult local guidance.
3. During the Study
Additional testing during the study may be performed per local regulations and/or at 
the discretion of the Investigator. Study treatment should be temporarily suspended if 
SARS-CoV-2 infection is diagnosed. If a participant receives SARS-CoV-2 
treatment, consult the Medical Monitor and/or the Sponsor's study Medical Director 
prior to restarting study treatment.
During the first 16 weeks of study treatment periods in Part 1 and Part 2, non-live 
COVID-19 vaccines are not permitted. COVID-19 vaccines may prompt temporary 
withholding or discontinuation of study treatment in order for the vaccine to exert its 
effect. Since temporary withholding or discontinuation could affect the primary 
analysis of safety and efficacy of the study treatment, COVID-19 vaccines are not 
allowed during the first 16 weeks of Part 1 and Part 2. 
After Week 16 in Part 1 and Part 2, the non-live COVID-19 vaccine may be 
administered at the discretion of the PI. In this case, participants may remain 
off-treatment for a maximum of 21 days after administration of the COVID-19 
vaccine (for the vaccine to exert its effect).
4. Statistical Considerations
Because of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the Sponsor plans to monitor the 
missing data attributed to SARS-CoV-2 external factors, such as restriction on travel 
as per local regulation for SARS-CoV-2.
Additional measures will be determined as per evolving local and regulatory requirements. 
General risk mitigation against SARS-CoV-2 may be implemented in accordance with the study 
sites institutional review board approved monitoring and prevention control measures. The risk 
mitigation measures, where applicable, will be amended based on emerging local, regional, and 
national guidance.
