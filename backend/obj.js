10 SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION AND OPERATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS (cont)

10.1.3 Confidentiality and Privacy
Participants will be identified by a unique number assigned at the time of the screening visit and
participant names and contact information will be known only to the investigator and research study
staff and will be securely stored at the investigational site for internal use during the study. Name or
other identifying data will not be used in any report or publication of this study.
The study monitor, other authorized representatives of the sponsor, representatives of the EC,
regulatory agencies or pharmaceutical company supplying study product may inspect all documents
and records required to be maintained by the investigator, including but not limited to, medical records
(office, clinic, or hospital) and pharmacy records for the participants in this study. The clinical study
site will permit access to such records.
Participant confidentiality and privacy is strictly held in trust by the participating investigators, their
staff, and the sponsor(s) and their interventions. Therefore, the study protocol, documentation, data
and all other information generated will be held in strict confidence. No information concerning the
study or the data will be released to any unauthorized third party without prior written approval of
the sponsor.
Sponsor, investigators, and research study staff agree to adhere to personal data protection
requirements in accordance with the European Union Data Protection Directive (EC/95/46) and any
applicable legislation enacted thereunder in the European Union (as it may be amended or superseded
including by the General data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (Regulation EU 2016/679), the German
Medicinal Products Act and any other applicable law with respect to personal data protection. The
investigator, research study staff and authorized representatives of the sponsor will be required to
process personal data arising from this study in accordance with instructions received from the
sponsor. They will be acting as data processor as defined by the GDPR.
The Sponsor may transfer some data collected during the study to a different company or regulatory
authority within/outside Europe for the purpose of processing, review, analysis, or storage. Whenever
the patients personal data is transferred, it will be kept confidential and secure, and will be used only
for the purpose for which it was collected.

10 SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION AND OPERATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS (cont)

10.1.10 Publication Policy
The sponsor is interested in the publication of the results of every study it performs. As some of the
information concerning the study drug and the sponsors development activities may be strictly
confidential, any publication manuscript or abstracts from the investigator (including conference
contributions, etc.) must first be reviewed by the sponsor before its submission or presentation. All
information regarding study drug supplied by sponsor to the investigator is privileged and confidential
information. The investigator agrees to use this information to accomplish the study and will not use
it for other purposes without consent from sponsor. It is understood that there is an obligation to
provide the sponsor with complete data obtained during the study. The information obtained from the
clinical study will be used towards the development of the study drug and may be disclosed to
regulatory authority(ies), other investigators, corporate partners or consultants as required.
It is anticipated that the results of this multi-center study will be presented at scientific meetings
and/or published in peer-reviewed scientific or medical journals. Publication of subgroup data and
single centre data shall not be performed until the complete study has been analysed and published.
All relevant aspects and details regarding publications will be part of the contract between the sponsor
and the investigator/institution and/or written agreements among all involved parties. Authorship will
be determined by mutual agreement and in line with International Committee of Medical Journal
Editors (ICMJE) authorship requirements. The individual contributions of each investigator in terms of
scientific input into trial design, active participation in terms of enrolment and data acquisition, and
input into data analysis / interpretation will be acknowledged and adequately reflected in the
authorship position. Other sub-investigators and members of the study team can be co-authors of the
publication(s) following the ICMJE guidance.
The sponsor will comply with the requirements for publication of study results. It is sponsors intent
that there may be sponsor authors named on the publication, if justified.

9 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS (cont.)

9.4 Statistical Analyses
9.4.1 General Approach
All data will be listed, and all variables will be summarized according to their type. Variables measured
on metrical scales will be summarized using descriptive statistics (number of non-missing observations,
arithmetic mean, sample standard deviation, median, minimum, first quartile, third quartile, and
maximum). Variables measured on ordinal or nominal scales will be summarized using frequency
tables showing the number and percentage of subjects falling within a particular category.
Missing data will be handled as such, i.e., no imputation of missing data is planned.
All details of the statistical analysis will be described in more detail in a statistical analysis plan, which
will be agreed upon before database closure.
Standard of truth
The standard of truth in this study is the result of the clinical diagnosis established through histological
verification of the presence or absence of AL amyloidosis with cardiac involvement determined
through either endomyocardial biopsy or through extracardiac biopsy in conjunction with typical CMR
or echo imaging features as the standard of truth (Section 8.1.2).
9.4.2 Analysis of the Primary Endpoints(s)
The co-primary efficacy variables (sensitivity and specificity) will be evaluated using five independent
individual blinded readers. Point estimates together with 95% confidence intervals of sensitivity and
specificity (relative to the standard of truth) will be assessed for each of the 5 readers separately.
Point estimates for the sensitivity and specificity of each reader will be calculated according to the
visual assessment and the standard of truth (Section 8.1.2) as described in the table below.
Table 2. Truth table of AL cardiac amyloidosis detection
Standard of Truth
AL-CA present AL-CA absent
Visual assessment AL-pos True positive (TP) False positive (FP)
AL-neg False negative (FN) True negative (TN)
The point estimate for sensitivity (?^????) and specificity (?^????) is calculated as:
[formula removed]
Where nsens and nspec are the sample size used to estimate sensitivity and specificity.
The following hypotheses are formulated:
 H0,sens: se??siti??ity ?? 0.6 ??s. H1,sens: sensitivity > 0.6
 H0,spec: spe??ifi??ity ?? 0.6 ??s. H1,spec: specificity > 0.6

H0,sens will be rejected if the lower bound of the two-sided 95% confidence is larger than 0.6 for at least
3 out of the 5 blinded readers.
H0,spec will be rejected if the lower bound of the two-sided 95% confidence is larger than 0.6 for at least
3 out of the 5 blinded readers.
9.4.3 Analysis of the Secondary Endpoints
Receiver operating characteristic curves will be applied to assess the performance of quantitative
[18F]florbetaben PET measurements in the detection of AL cardiac amyloidosis.
Association of PET results with the parameters of left ventricular function (LV ejection fraction and LV
mass) will be assessed by means of scatter plots and correlation coefficients.
Association of PET results with the disease stage based on FLC-diff, cTnT and NT-proBNP levels1 will be
assessed by means of scatter plots and correlation coefficients. If required, cTnT may be replaced by
cTnI; NT-proBNP by BNP. The respective threshold values for disease staging are derived from recent
literature22-23:
Impact of [18F]florbetaben PET on diagnostic thinking and patient management will be assessed by
means of the change in clinical diagnosis and diagnosis confidence after intermediate PET read has
been provided to the investigator.
9.4.4 Safety Analyses
Analysis of safety parameters will include all vital signs, and AE data listed by subject. The safety
variable will be evaluated according to their scale. Continuous variables will be evaluated using
descriptive statistics. Categorical and ordinal variables will be evaluated using frequency tables.
9.4.5 Planned Interim Analyses
No interim analysis is planned.

10 SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION AND OPERATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS

10.1 Regulatory, Ethical, and Study Oversight Considerations
This clinical study was designed and shall be implemented and reported in accordance with the ICH
Guidelines for GCP, with applicable local regulations and with the ethical principles laid down in the
Declaration of Helsinki.
The protocol and the proposed informed consent form must be reviewed and approved by a properly
constituted EC before study start. A signed and dated statement that the protocol and informed
consent have been approved by the EC must be present before study initiation. Prior to study start,
the investigator is required to sign a protocol signature page confirming his/her agreement to conduct
the study in accordance with these documents and all instructions and procedures found in this
protocol and to give access to all relevant data and records to the contracted monitor, auditors, EC,
and regulatory authorities, as required.
10.1.1 Informed Consent Process
10.1.1.1 Consent and other informational documents provided to participants
The informed consent form(s), recruitment materials and all participant materials will have received
approval from the EC and any applicable regulatory bodies.
Potential patients may only be included in the study after providing written (witnessed, where required
by law or regulation) informed consent. Informed consent must be obtained before conducting any
study-specific procedures (i.e., all of the study-specific procedures described in the protocol).
10.1.1.2 Consent procedures and documentation
The investigator will be responsible for deciding whether a patient is able to provide informed consent.
This judgment will be based upon an overall impression of each patients ability to comprehend
relevant information and make a reasoned decision. The patient will sign the consent section of the
informed consent document.
The process of obtaining informed consent should be documented in the patient source documents.
10.1.2 Study Discontinuation and Closure
This study may be temporarily suspended or prematurely terminated if there is sufficient reasonable
cause. Written notification, documenting the reason for study suspension or termination, will be
provided by the suspending or terminating party to study participants, investigator and regulatory
authorities. If the study is prematurely terminated or suspended, the Principal Investigator will
promptly inform study participants, the EC and sponsor and will provide the reason(s) for the
termination or suspension. Study participants will be contacted, as applicable, and be informed of
changes to study visit schedule.
Circumstances that may warrant termination or suspension include, but are not limited to:
 Determination of unexpected, significant, or unacceptable risk to participants
 Demonstration of efficacy that would warrant stopping
 Insufficient compliance to protocol requirements
 Data that are not sufficiently complete and/or evaluable
 Determination that the primary endpoint has been met
 Determination of futility
 Administrative reasons
Study may resume once concerns about safety, protocol compliance, and data quality are addressed,
and satisfy the sponsor, EC, and regulatory authorities, as applicable.

STUDY INTERVENTION DISCONTINUATION AND PARTICIPANT
DISCONTINUATION / WITHDRAWAL
7.1 Discontinuation of Study Intervention and Premature Subject Withdrawal
Patients may voluntarily withdraw from the study for any reason at any time. They may be considered
withdrawn if they state an intention to withdraw, fail to return for visits, or become lost to follow-up
for any other reason. If premature withdrawal occurs for any reason, the investigator must make every
effort to determine the primary reason for a patients premature withdrawal from the study and
document this information in the study files.
In addition, a patient may be withdrawn by the investigator or the sponsor if enrolment into the study
is inappropriate, in case of protocol violation, or for administrative and/or other safety reasons.
Patients may develop AEs or abnormalities in vital signs, physical examination, or laboratory
determinations during their participation in the study. If these occur, the investigator may discontinue
a patient from the study if, in his/her clinical judgment, continued participation would result in undue
risk or further worsening of the condition.
All radiotracer related Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) will be reviewed by the sponsor for determination
of appropriate actions.
The investigator must provide follow-up evaluation by phone or by clinic visit for all patients who are
prematurely withdrawn from the study or must refer them for appropriate ongoing care.
