Ideally, this all happens before the general contractor is even selected. Why? Because the technology plans will impact the GC’s scope of work, and so we want that impact to be made clear BEFORE the GC lines up their ducks. This helps to avoid timely and costly change orders. From there, we are actively involved with the full build of your home, coordinating tightly with you, your architect, the GC and the other trades. If we had to summarize our process philosophy in one sentence, it might be, you can’t over communicate! Contact us now to schedule your free consultation. “The technology design should begin shortly after the architect’s schematic design phase begins.”

The WiFi access point in your master bedroom closet needs category 6 cable run to the switch in your basement. The cable box and Apple TV in the equipment cabinet need HDMI or shielded category 6 cables to the TV The speakers in the ceiling need 14 gauge wire run to the amplifier The TV needs various cables for network and control connections What’s more, you don’t just need wiring for the devices you will have on day 1, you need wiring for the future devices you will want to install. Having inadequate wiring in place will not only limit what technology features and functions are feasible to deploy in your home, it will also compromise the quality and reliability of the functions you do have. Again, proper planning is the key to avoiding this pitfall. The solution is to produce what’s known as a Structured Wiring Plan. This should be developed in concert with the Device Location Plan and coordinated with the rest of the architectural documents for your home. By WHC Admin|

The first step is a review of the early stage plans for your home and a detailed discussion about which technologies you wish to incorporate. Indeed, there are many to choose from, including WiFi, smart lighting, smart HVAC control, distributed audio, distributed video, home theater, motorized shades – and the list goes on. We have meeting formats and technology templates that make the process of creating a preliminary design straight forward and even exciting. Once the preliminary design is established, we will provide you with a custom Technology Design & Budget Guide. This detailed document explains the price range you could expect to realize the initial design. Next, we iterate. The design and budget guide will lead us to design refinements, which in turn will lead to an updated budget. We iterate until we have a design that best meets your needs and budget. This culminates in a detailed proposal, clarifying the final decisions we’ve reached about technology selection in the home and the associated costs.
