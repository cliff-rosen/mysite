WITH SEE NOx REDUCTION IN A WHOLE NEW LIGHT While controls at source are a primary form of pollution management, they are not the complete solution. Photocatalysts, TiO2 based substances that use light energy to clean, represent leading edge technology for post-tail pipe pollution control. Based on field trials, significant NOx reductions are achievable with powerful photocatalysts in highly polluted environments. PURETi is an advanced photocatalytic technology that can be applied to surfaces to remove harmful pollutants at the point of reception. PURETi reduces the harmful effects of air pollution on human health, plant/animal life, and the environment by effectively reducing NOx levels in the presence of natural UV-A light. Semiconductor Photocatalysis (SPC) as it Interacts with NOx How it works THE SCIENCE BEHIND HOW PURETI DESTROYS NOx  Light energy activates the PURETi treated surface  PURETi then uses this energy to transform humidity in the air into Super Oxide Anions (O2-), one of natures strongest reducing agents, that transform NOx into harmless by-products (H2O, CO2) and mineral nitrates (CaNO3)  The process repeats itself millions of times per second in the presence of natural light to effectively reduce NOx LIGHT ENERGY FROM THE SUN N WATER C CARBON DIOXIDE N Ca HARMLESS MINERAL NITRATE TO2 PURETi Treated Surface Light energy activates the PURETi treated surface. Super Oxide anions (O2-) are formed with water molecules interact with PURETi treated surface Resulting in harmless by products and mineral nitrates The super oxide anions interact with NOx to remove it from atmosphere by transforming NOx into nitric acids and nat- uralizing when combined with CaCO3 USE THE POWER OF LIGHT TO CLEAN Back  SEE NOx REDUCTION IN A WHOLE NEW LIGHT WITH A Revolutionary Technology To Reduce Air Pollution PURETi is an exterior, spray application that uses the power of light to transform surfaces to combat pollution, significantly reduce NOx and create cleaner, healthier air. It is a safe, viable, simple and cost effective innovation that completes a comprehensive NOx reduction strategy.

PURETi is spray-applied clear, dries invisibly and leaves no visible change to the surface upon application. Large areas can be treated in a single day or night, without construction activity and can be fully utilized by the public within hours. 1km Cost Effective Solution PURETi delivers immediate and continuous results, making it among the most cost effective solutions on the market to control and combat the effects of NOx. Compared to other air quality solutions requiring extensive investment to achieve air quality improvements, PURETi can be implemented quickly and easily without costly infrastructure changes or economic disruption. When combined with more mainstream Air Quality policies, the benefits of: immediate results, speed to market, and ease of implementation make PURETi a cost effect solution to improve air quality within EU NO2 limits. Part of a Comprehensive NOx Reduction Strategy PURETi is a state-of-the-art photocatalyst that compliments a comprehensive NOx reduction strategy. It is a viable, economical and easy to implement innovation that provides control beyond the source to help control post-tailpipe pollution. PURETi is beneficial at the point of reception, to provide another level of protection against the harmful effects of NOx. 1km treated with PURETi removes the NOx effects of 162 vehicles from the road.
