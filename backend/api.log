Who We Are crosen 2019-08-07T13:14:10+00:00 Whole Home Control was founded in 2008 by Cliff Rosen, a technology veteran with more than 20 years experience designing and building technology solutions of all shapes and sizes. Cliff formed the company after renovating his NYC apartment and going through the meticulous process of specifying the technology and working closely with the architect and GC to bring it to life as an integral part of the apartment’s architecture. The process was inspiring for Cliff, who currently serves as CEO and CTO. Prior to starting Whole Home Control, Cliff’s technology experience ranged from pioneering work developing an image capable inventory management system for The Pace Gallery – a leading contemporary art gallery – to co-founding sixdegrees.com – the Internet’s first social networking site.

What We Do WHC Admin 2017-10-17T06:21:07+00:00 We are a boutique home technology integrator serving the high end residential market in NYC and surrounding areas. Our job as a home technology integrator is to provide technology that maximizes the usefulness of your home while seamlessly integrating with your home’s architecture. While we work with a broad array of technology applications, the key applications featured in most of our projects include: Home Networking / WiFi Smart Lighting HVAC (Heating and Air Conditioning) Video / Distributed Video / Home Theater Audio / Distributed Audio Motorized Shades Surveillance These applications are all seamlessly tied together with a “central brain” or controller. Our platform of choice for this controller is Control4. We are a full service design-build firm, but also are happy to work in a design or consulting capacity.

Lighting that is not only very easy to control, but also more architecturally friendly because “keypads” now replace large, unsightly banks of light switches. Video and audio systems that give you the sights and sounds you want without so much gear cluttering your space and certainly without any visible wires. “Orchestrated control” of lights, audio, video, security, heating and cooling, door locks, etc. In other words, you can easily change the state of any or all of these systems together with a single button press, a scheduled event, etc. Control over these systems from a phone or tablet, whether you are sitting on the Great Room couch or half way around the world. To be sure, the list goes on. But, if you start with these ideas in mind as you build your new home, you are headed in the right direction to make it a smart home. By WHC Admin|
