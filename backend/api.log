As one of Greater Bostons leading landlords, were here for our customers and communities when they need us most, with operating buildings and supportive property management, however, we strongly recommend all tenants follow the policies your company has set forth.

Here are some of the steps we are taking to protect our customers and team members:
In Our Buildings:
 Increased cleaning commonly used areas more often, including lobbies, bathrooms, elevators, caf and fitness areas, and high touch point areas such as doorknobs and handles, elevator buttons, railings and the like.
 Sanitizing restrooms more frequently and restocking with supplies, including soap, paper towels and hand sanitizer.
 Adding extra hand sanitizer in as many locations as possible.
 Wiping down relevant equipment.
 Partnering with our suppliers to replenish high-demand cleaning products.
 Continuing to provide our customers with free hand sanitizer at our building entrances.
