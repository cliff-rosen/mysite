RESERVATIONS AND TICKETING How does our Ticket Pricing work? Circle Line uses a dynamic pricing approach to setting ticket prices. What does this mean?

We do this because our boats have a limited capacity. We weren't the first to come up with this idea: this comes from airlines and hotels. What is a Reserved Ticket?
