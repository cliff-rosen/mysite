DETAILED CLEANING PROCEDURE

1

2

A dry or slightly damp microfiber  

towel is all you need to clean

Day 2-30

+

Water

Microfiber

Routine Daily or  
Weekly Cleaning
Spot clean only the dirty areas of the glass 
with a dry or slightly damp microfiber cloth.  
Use water or PURETi Clean & Fresh to 
dampen the cloth.  There is no need to  
re-clean the entire surface! 

Product Application

1.  Spray PURETi directly on the glass, not the 
towel. Work in manageable 3’ x 3’ sections 
and apply liberally, lightly covering each 
section with the product. Don’t let the 
product dry before wiping!

2.  Use gentle pressure to wipe the surface 
clean and dry. The goal is to “polish” the 
PURETi onto the surface, not scrape it off.
3.  Replace your towel with a new one when it 
becomes saturated or dirty. Leave all areas 
dry and streak free.

3 Re-Application

Every 30 days, or as needed, re-apply PURETi Clean & Fresh  
to the entire window surface as noted above.
