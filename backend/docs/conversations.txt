Conversations

All calls from frontend to get_answer occurs in the context of a conversation.
Each conversation has a unique conversation_id
Front end assigns either an existing id or "NEW" for each all

If id is "NEW":
 a new 20 character ID is generated
 the submitted prompt is created from query, chunks, and input prompt
 a new record is inserted into the conversation table
    conversation_text is set to submitted prompt + answer

If id is provided:
 existing conversation record is retrieved from db
 the submitted prompt is a concatation of:
    conversation_text from db + 'Question: ' + query + 'Answer: ' + answer
 existing conversation record is updated with conversation_text = submitted_prompt
