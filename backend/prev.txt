Jun 1, 2022 Episode 11 of the Medical Affairs Unscripted podcast series recorded by Zipher, now part of Lumanity As the pharmaceutical landscape becomes more and more competitive, Medical affairs organizations must master the art of employing and developing top level Medical Science Liaisons (MSLs) to enhance and accelerate the competitive advantage. Medical affairs organizations must know how to conduct an insightful assessment of what it takes to cultivate the natural diversity of skills and capabilities of a field medical team, enhance internal peer-to-peer development, and foster external stakeholder rapport. We invited Christina Tankersley, PharmD, Senior Director Field Medical Team at Sanofi Pasteur, to discuss how to build, train, and guide the growth of a diverse and multi-disciplinary field medical team. Christinas over two-decade career began in the field as an MSL and now leads the field medical vaccine team. Christina joins Dr Peg Crowley-Nowick on the second season of Medical Affairs Unscripted to share her invaluable experience developing high-performing MSLs, intentionally identifying the key diversities required for constructing a balanced and symbiotic MSL team, and ways to overcome the challenges of unifying team members across the ever-present virtual office setting. Dr Crowley-Nowick also draws on Christinas vast experience by discussing the potential pitfalls related to the industrys condensed onboarding trends and the risks associated with driving MSLs into the field prematurely. Lastly, Christina characterizes an MSL journey, the fundamental cornerstone of an MSL development plan and highlights the key components for MSL development, evaluation, and optimization. Podcast Series: Medical Affairs Unscripted Hosted by Dr Peggy Crowley-Nowick, in Medical Affairs Unscripted we explore a range of topics related to the strategic role of medical affairs from the perspective of industry experts. Through these conversations with our guests we will share first hand experience to provide the listener with insights and knowledge about the evolving role of medical affairs.
