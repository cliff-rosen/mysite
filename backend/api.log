How Much is an Idea Worth?
Whenever I've chatted with founders of "stealth start-ups", I've noticed that they tend to be very guarded about their business. "What do you do?" I ask. "I can't tell you," they respond. "Well what problem are you solving?" I continue. "I can't tell you that either,"...

2) Cost Per Sales Accepted Lead <by Channel>
In this example we are looking at the cost per sales accepted lead (SAL) by channel. Once you have a good sense of your average cost and the maximum acceptable cost, you can evaluate if any of your channels are simply too expensive to pursue. Make sure that when you compute your expenses you include the fully loaded costs of peoples time on your team. For instance Social Media may require a full time head count whereas Organic Search may require only a couple of hours a month.

Why Pay for Leads?
We created a lead generation program that only cost $3K and became the #1 source of leads for this public company. The best part of this program was that leads continued to flow in for years without any additional expense or work on anyones behalf. Just set it and forget it.

Youll want to evaluate your ROMI for each of your channels (and sources, campaigns & assets). Make sure that you fully load all cost information into your calculations accounting for both direct costs (like advertising expenditure) and indirect costs (like the % of someones time spent which should be a dollar value based on the persons fully loaded compensation).
