Data Processing Steps

TO DO:
- add logging to capture links missing content, etc.
- step 2a: look for and remove irrelevant chunks

- PREPARE -

1. Create domain record in db

2. Update domain_id in 3 processing scripts

3. Review site using inspect and establish which tag, tag id or class to spider.  Update domain record spider_notes with that info and then update the get_page_contents() to retrieve proper target

- RUN -

1. Step 1
 Verify get_page_contents retrieval logic
 Set single to true
 Set domain to "https://domain.com", with no / at end
 Run script and verify:
  console shows content found in correct section (i.e. id=main)
  content written to page.txt is correct
 Change single to False and run Step 1 fully
 Check logfile and db document table

2. Step 2
set chunk_maker
set domain_id
run script
check logfile
check db document_chunks table
  search for long chunks

3. Step 3
set domain_id
run script
check logfile
verify:
 select count(*) from document_chunk
 compare with index count in Pinecone console

4. Create user

- TEST -

1. Login as user and test
- domain defaults to correct value
- "what does this company do" ; check chunks and response


Other tests:
check for chunks that are very long
SELECT domain_id, LENGTH(chunk_text), doc_chunk_id
FROM document_chunk dc
JOIN document d ON dc.doc_id = d.doc_id
WHERE LENGTH(chunk_text) > 2000
ORDER BY domain_id
