Data Processing Steps

TO DO:
- add logging to capture links missing content, etc.

1. Create domain record in db

2. Update domain_id in 3 processing scripts

3. Review site using inspect and establish which tag, tag id or class to spider.  Update domain record with that info and then update the get_page_contents() to retrieve proper target

4. Step 1
 Set single to true
 Set domain to "https://domain.com", with no / at end
 Run script and verify content written to page.txt is correct.
 Change single to False and run Step 1 fully

5. Step 2
set chunk_maker
set domain_id
run script

6. Step 3
set domain_id
run script
verify:
 select count(*) from document_chunk
 compare with index count in Pinecone console

7. Create user

8. Login as user and test
- domain defaults to correct value
- "what does this company do" ; check chunks and response

Other tests:
check for chunks that are very long
SELECT domain_id, LENGTH(chunk_text), doc_chunk_id
FROM document_chunk dc
JOIN document d ON dc.doc_id = d.doc_id
WHERE LENGTH(chunk_text) > 2000
ORDER BY domain_id
