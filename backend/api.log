NEW MODEL
You are a professional working as a customer service representative for a company.
The following question is from a potential customer.
Answer the question as truthfully as possible.  
Use only the provided context and no further information to answer the question.
If you are not certain of the answer, say "I don't know."

<START OF CONTEXT>
Statistical Methods The co-primary efficacy variables of the study will be evaluated using 5
independent individual blinded readers. The sensitivity and specificity will be
assessed for each of the 5 readers. The 95% confidence intervals will be
calculated for the individual blinded readers separately.
The following hypotheses will be tested:
 H0,sens: se??siti??ity ?? 0.6 ??s. H1,sens: sensitivity > 0.6
 H0,spec: spe??ifi??ity ?? 0.6 vs. H1,spec: specificity > 0.6
H0,sens will be rejected if the lower bound of the two-sided 95% confidence is
larger than 0.6 for at least 3 out of the 5 blinded readers.
H0,spec will be rejected if the lower bound of the two-sided 95% confidence is
larger than 0.6 for at least 3 out of the 5 blinded readers.

Sample size justification
Assuming a true sensitivity and specificity of 85%, the sample size was
calculated to test whether the sensitivity and specificity (s) in 3 out of 5
readers is larger than a reference value of s0=0.6 using the method described
by Chow et al2. (H0: s=s0; H1: s > s0). Correction for multiple comparison to
the reference value will be performed using Bonferronis method. Assuming
a true sensitivity and specificity of 85% (s=0.85, alpha=0.05 and power=0.9),
a minimum of 48 patients per group yield a sufficiently narrow confidence
interval for the assessment of the primary endpoint. Given the three
population groups recruited (non-CA, AL and ATTR), up to 200 subjects will
need to be enrolled in this study.

10 SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION AND OPERATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS (cont)

10.1.6 Quality Assurance and Quality Control
Each investigational site will perform internal quality management of study conduct, data and
biological specimen collection, documentation, and completion.
Quality control procedures will be implemented beginning with the data entry system and data quality
control checks that will be run on the database will be generated. Any missing data or data anomalies
will be communicated to the site(s) for clarification/resolution.
Following written Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), the monitors will verify that the study is
conducted and data are generated and biological specimens are collected, documented (recorded),
and reported in compliance with the protocol, ICH GCP and applicable regulatory requirements.

The investigational site will provide direct access to all study related files, source data/documents and
reports for the purpose of monitoring and auditing by the sponsor, and inspection by local and
regulatory authorities.
10.1.7 Indemnification
In the event of study-related damage or injuries, the public liability insurance of the sponsor provides
compensation for claims that arise in accordance with the regulatory requirements of the countries
involved, except for claims that arise from willful misconduct or gross negligence. A copy of the
insurance certificates will be held in the Trial Master File (TMF) and ISF.

Study scheme

This is an open-label, multi-center, pivotal Phase 3 study without randomization (Figure 1). All eligible patients will receive a single administration of the imaging agent [18F]florbetaben at a radioactive dose of 300 MBq. The study will be structured into three main activities: Screening, [18F]florbetaben PET imaging including follow up and assessment of the impact of PET results on diagnostic thinking and patient management (Figure 2).
The completion of this study protocol for all patients comprises the following components:
 Medical and physical assessments at screening
 [18F]florbetaben PET imaging visit
 Safety follow-up phone call 4 days (2 days) and 15 days (2 days) after the [18F]florbetaben PET imaging visit
 Routine diagnostic procedures according to standard of care
 Questionnaire on diagnostic thinking and patient management of the investigator
The evaluations included at screening visit and at the PET imaging visit are summarized in Section 1.3 Schedule of Activities. After patients have met all study entry criteria, patients will be enrolled and will participate in the [18F]florbetaben PET imaging session. Follow-up phone calls for AE assessment will occur 4 days (2 days) and 15 days (+/- 2days) following the PET imaging visit.
After enrolment a routine diagnostic work-up will be performed, which is not part of this protocol and at the discretion of the treating physician according to standard of care. After a diagnosis is made, the investigator receives the preliminary results from the PET imaging assessed by a local nuclear medicine physician. The impact of the PET result on diagnostic thinking and patient management is assessed.

After enrolment, patients will undergo the routine diagnostic work up. In parallel a [18F]florbetaben PET imaging visit is scheduled. Local diagnosis and local PET scan results are used for the determination of the impact of PET results on diagnostic thinking and patient management. After study end, final SoT diagnosis will be determined by an external expert panel, final PET interpretation will be performed
after by independent external image readers.

STUDY DESIGN
Study Blinding

4.2.1 Primary efficacy analysis: External SoT diagnosis and external PET image
interpretation
The members of the external expert panel establishing the final SoT-based diagnosis used for the
primary and secondary endpoints related to diagnostic efficacy will be independent from any study
site and not be involved in the study conduct. They will be fully blinded to the PET results (both local
and external reads). The panel will be provided with the clinical information available at the time when
the local diagnosis was established (Day x, see Figure 2), but will be blinded to the diagnosis of the
local physician. Any clinical data that were generated after the data of the local PET interpretation
were shared with the investigator are not provided to the external panel to avoid incorporation bias.
The 5 independent readers for the external read of the PET scans will be independent from any study
site and not be involved in the study conduct. They will be fully blinded to the SoT diagnosis and any
other patient-specific information such as medical history, laboratory results etc. The readers will have
access only to the relevant PET and anatomical images marked with study specific patient identifiers.
The read will require a forced positive/negative determination.
The data share to the external panel and the external readers will be controlled by the CRO.
4.2.2 On-site diagnosis and evaluation of PET images
The local PET read will be used for the evaluation of the impact of [18F]florbetaben PET imaging on
diagnostic thinking and patient management. The local physician establishing the clinical diagnosis
based on the diagnostic work-up after the PET imaging visit will be kept blinded to the local PET results
until the diagnosis is established and documented. The nuclear medicine physician conducting the PET
scan is obliged not to share any preliminary diagnostic information derived from the scans with the
referring physician and will be asked to refrain from uploading the PET images into the local system.
The local nuclear medicine physician will sign a corresponding non-disclosure form.
The local nuclear medicine physician will be blinded for the SoT diagnosis and will not have access to
the respective pages of the eCRF.
The local physician establishing the diagnosis will fill in the questionnaire on diagnostic thinking. The
eCRF pages on the local PET results will be disclosed to them only after the patients clinical diagnosis
has been established based on the routine clinical assessment and part 2 of the questionnaire on
diagnostic thinking has been completed (Day x, see Figure 2) to avoid information carry-over.
Disclosure of the local PET results will be controlled by the CRO.
4.3 Justification for Dose
The recommended activity for an adult is 300 MBq [18F]florbetaben. The maximum dose should not
exceed 360 MBq and not fall below 240 MBq at time of administration. The volume of [18F]florbetaben
to be injected can be from 0.5 to 10 mL in order to provide the target activity of 300 MBq at the time
of i.v. administration.
Radioactivity dose dependencies were not investigated. As a general principle, radioactivity dose
activities were chosen in a way to allow for well tolerable radiation doses on the one hand, with suitable imaging signal and contrast on the other hand. Therefore, target activities tested were always
between 250 MBq and 300 MBq. The [18F]florbetaben IB provides further information regarding
dosage.
4.4 Beginning and End of Study Definition
The overall study begins when the first patient signs the informed consent form. The overall study ends
at last patient last visit, i.e. when the last patient will have completed the safety follow-up phone call
after the [18F]florbetaben PET imaging visit, the clinical diagnosis (SoT) has been established and the
questionnaire on diagnostic thinking has been finalized by the investigator for this patient.

STUDY DESIGN
4.1 Overall Design
This is an open-label, multi-center, pivotal Phase 3 study without randomization. All eligible patients
will receive a single administration of the imaging agent [18F]florbetaben at a radioactive dose of 300
MBq.
All patients will provide written informed consent before any study procedures are performed. The
screening procedures to assess patient eligibility will occur within 28 days of the [18F]florbetaben PET
imaging visit and will include the following clinical assessment: review of medical history and
medications, physical examination, laboratory tests (chemistry, hematology, urinalysis). Patients will
be considered enrolled when all eligibility criteria have been verified.
All enrolled patients with suspected cardiac amyloidosis will undergo a [18F]florbetaben PET imaging.
At the imaging visit, [18F]florbetaben will be injected intravenously (i.v.). Dynamic PET acquisition of
the thorax will be performed from 0 to 45 min post-injection (p.i.). Whole body scanning will be
performed from 45 to approx. 60 min p.i. starting from the base of the skull to the mid-thighs (2-3 min
per bed position).
AEs will be monitored during the [18F]florbetaben imaging session. The investigator or designee will
evaluate the patient for AEs prior to discharge from the imaging center. Patients who experience an
AE will not be discharged from the imaging center until the event has resolved or stabilized. Safety
follow-up phone calls to the patient will occur 4 days and 15 days (2 days) after the PET imaging visit
to confirm patient well-being and to collect information about any new AEs.
Routine clinical assessment may start after enrolment not to delay the clinical diagnosis and respective
treatment.
A final diagnosis, as defined by the SoT, will be established at the end of the study by an external expert
panel, which is blinded to the PET results. Only diagnostic data obtained before the local PET results
were shared with the local investigator will be considered for the SoT diagnosis and be provided to the
external panel.
The final blinded read of the PET images will be done at the end of the study by 5 independent blinded
readers, who do not have access to the clinical data of the patients. These PET scan results from the
individual patients will be compared to the SoT based diagnosis established by the external expert
panel and sensitivity and specificity will be calculated.
The potential impact of PET imaging on diagnostic thinking and patient management will be assessed
by a 3-part questionnaire to be answered after enrolment, after local diagnosis derived from clinical
work-up and after the provision of local PET results. To ensure that the questionnaires can be answered
in a timely fashion to minimize recall bias, the evaluation will be based on local diagnosis and local PET
image reads. The local image read will be performed by the local nuclear medicine physician after
each individual PET has been acquired. The binary PET result (AL deposition in the heart YES/NO) will
be provided to the investigator only after he/she established the patients clinical diagnosis based on
the routine clinical assessment. This local read will be used for the investigator to complete the last
part of the questionnaire on diagnostic thinking and patient management.
After the end of the study patients will be treated according to the local clinical standard of care.

Assistant: Hello, how can I help you?

User: what study is this
Chatbot: This is a Phase 3 study to evaluate the diagnostic efficacy of [18F]florbetaben PET imaging in patients with suspected cardiac amyloidosis or with a putative diagnosis of cardiac amyloidosis but with remaining diagnostic uncertainty. Up to 200 patients will be enrolled in this study.

User: how does it work
Assistant: In this study, eligible patients will receive a single administration of the imaging agent [18F]florbetaben at a radioactive dose of 300 MBq. The study will be structured into three main activities: Screening, [18F]florbetaben PET imaging including follow up and assessment of the impact of PET results on diagnostic thinking and patient management. 

After patients have met all study entry criteria, patients will participate in the [18F]florbetaben PET imaging session. Follow-up phone calls for AE assessment will occur 4 days (2 days) and 15 days (+/- 2days) following the PET imaging visit. 

A final diagnosis will be established at the end of the study by an external expert panel, which is blinded to the PET results. The impact of the PET result on diagnostic thinking and patient management is assessed by filling out a questionnaire on diagnostic thinking and patient management.
