Study scheme

This is an open-label, multi-center, pivotal Phase 3 study without randomization (Figure 1). All eligible patients will receive a single administration of the imaging agent [18F]florbetaben at a radioactive dose of 300 MBq. The study will be structured into three main activities: Screening, [18F]florbetaben PET imaging including follow up and assessment of the impact of PET results on diagnostic thinking and patient management (Figure 2).
The completion of this study protocol for all patients comprises the following components:
 Medical and physical assessments at screening
 [18F]florbetaben PET imaging visit
 Safety follow-up phone call 4 days (2 days) and 15 days (2 days) after the [18F]florbetaben PET imaging visit
 Routine diagnostic procedures according to standard of care
 Questionnaire on diagnostic thinking and patient management of the investigator
The evaluations included at screening visit and at the PET imaging visit are summarized in Section 1.3 Schedule of Activities. After patients have met all study entry criteria, patients will be enrolled and will participate in the [18F]florbetaben PET imaging session. Follow-up phone calls for AE assessment will occur 4 days (2 days) and 15 days (+/- 2days) following the PET imaging visit.
After enrolment a routine diagnostic work-up will be performed, which is not part of this protocol and at the discretion of the treating physician according to standard of care. After a diagnosis is made, the investigator receives the preliminary results from the PET imaging assessed by a local nuclear medicine physician. The impact of the PET result on diagnostic thinking and patient management is assessed.

After enrolment, patients will undergo the routine diagnostic work up. In parallel a [18F]florbetaben PET imaging visit is scheduled. Local diagnosis and local PET scan results are used for the determination of the impact of PET results on diagnostic thinking and patient management. After study end, final SoT diagnosis will be determined by an external expert panel, final PET interpretation will be performed
after by independent external image readers.

Statistical Methods The co-primary efficacy variables of the study will be evaluated using 5
independent individual blinded readers. The sensitivity and specificity will be
assessed for each of the 5 readers. The 95% confidence intervals will be
calculated for the individual blinded readers separately.
The following hypotheses will be tested:
 H0,sens: se??siti??ity ?? 0.6 ??s. H1,sens: sensitivity > 0.6
 H0,spec: spe??ifi??ity ?? 0.6 vs. H1,spec: specificity > 0.6
H0,sens will be rejected if the lower bound of the two-sided 95% confidence is
larger than 0.6 for at least 3 out of the 5 blinded readers.
H0,spec will be rejected if the lower bound of the two-sided 95% confidence is
larger than 0.6 for at least 3 out of the 5 blinded readers.

STUDY DESIGN
Study Blinding

4.2.1 Primary efficacy analysis: External SoT diagnosis and external PET image
interpretation
The members of the external expert panel establishing the final SoT-based diagnosis used for the
primary and secondary endpoints related to diagnostic efficacy will be independent from any study
site and not be involved in the study conduct. They will be fully blinded to the PET results (both local
and external reads). The panel will be provided with the clinical information available at the time when
the local diagnosis was established (Day x, see Figure 2), but will be blinded to the diagnosis of the
local physician. Any clinical data that were generated after the data of the local PET interpretation
were shared with the investigator are not provided to the external panel to avoid incorporation bias.
The 5 independent readers for the external read of the PET scans will be independent from any study
site and not be involved in the study conduct. They will be fully blinded to the SoT diagnosis and any
other patient-specific information such as medical history, laboratory results etc. The readers will have
access only to the relevant PET and anatomical images marked with study specific patient identifiers.
The read will require a forced positive/negative determination.
The data share to the external panel and the external readers will be controlled by the CRO.
4.2.2 On-site diagnosis and evaluation of PET images
The local PET read will be used for the evaluation of the impact of [18F]florbetaben PET imaging on
diagnostic thinking and patient management. The local physician establishing the clinical diagnosis
based on the diagnostic work-up after the PET imaging visit will be kept blinded to the local PET results
until the diagnosis is established and documented. The nuclear medicine physician conducting the PET
scan is obliged not to share any preliminary diagnostic information derived from the scans with the
referring physician and will be asked to refrain from uploading the PET images into the local system.
The local nuclear medicine physician will sign a corresponding non-disclosure form.
The local nuclear medicine physician will be blinded for the SoT diagnosis and will not have access to
the respective pages of the eCRF.
The local physician establishing the diagnosis will fill in the questionnaire on diagnostic thinking. The
eCRF pages on the local PET results will be disclosed to them only after the patients clinical diagnosis
has been established based on the routine clinical assessment and part 2 of the questionnaire on
diagnostic thinking has been completed (Day x, see Figure 2) to avoid information carry-over.
Disclosure of the local PET results will be controlled by the CRO.
4.3 Justification for Dose
The recommended activity for an adult is 300 MBq [18F]florbetaben. The maximum dose should not
exceed 360 MBq and not fall below 240 MBq at time of administration. The volume of [18F]florbetaben
to be injected can be from 0.5 to 10 mL in order to provide the target activity of 300 MBq at the time
of i.v. administration.
Radioactivity dose dependencies were not investigated. As a general principle, radioactivity dose
activities were chosen in a way to allow for well tolerable radiation doses on the one hand, with suitable imaging signal and contrast on the other hand. Therefore, target activities tested were always
between 250 MBq and 300 MBq. The [18F]florbetaben IB provides further information regarding
dosage.
4.4 Beginning and End of Study Definition
The overall study begins when the first patient signs the informed consent form. The overall study ends
at last patient last visit, i.e. when the last patient will have completed the safety follow-up phone call
after the [18F]florbetaben PET imaging visit, the clinical diagnosis (SoT) has been established and the
questionnaire on diagnostic thinking has been finalized by the investigator for this patient.

STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES (cont)

8.1.2 Non Study-specific Procedures: Routine Diagnostic Work-up
After enrolment, patients will be subjected to diagnostic procedures according to standard of care to
resolve diagnostic uncertainties and to clarify possible cardiac involvement. The diagnostic work up
may start before the PET imaging procedure to ensure an undelayed diagnosis and treatment start.
Physicians performing the diagnostic work-up will be kept blinded to the [18F]florbetaben PET scan
results.
The results of the clinical work-up (based on the assessments described in 8.1.2.1 and 8.1.2.2 according
to expert consensus recommendations17), will be used as standard of truth to compare to
[18F]florbetaben PET imaging results for the efficacy assessment. LV ejection fraction [%] and LV mass
index [g/m2] are obtained by echocardiography or CMR according to guidelines during routine
diagnostic work-up. These data will be analyzed to establish a correlation with quantitative PET results.
8.1.2.1 SoT for the establishment of a diagnosis of cardiac AL amyloidosis

features*
Absence of cardiac AL amyloidosis:
 Endomyocardial biopsy assessed as negative for AL amyloidosis
OR
 Extracardiac biopsy assessed as negative for AL amyloidosis and typical imaging features* for
cardiac amyloidosis absent
OR

nulling
2. Echo:
a. LV wall thickness >12 mm AND
b. Relative apical sparing of global Longitudinal Strain (LS) ratio (average of apical LS/average of
combined mid+basal LS >1) and Cherry-on-the-top sign on STE longitudinal strain bullseye

longitudinal strain)
AND at least one of the following:
c. ?? G??ade 2 diastoli?? dysfu????tion OR
d. Decreased global longitudinal LV strain (absolute value less than 16%)
A final diagnosis, as defined by the SoT, will be established by an external expert panel at the end of
the study. The expert panel will consist of three experts with experience in diagnosing cardiac
amyloidosis, e.g. specialized cardiologists, hematologists and/or radiologists.

Number of study subjects

Up to 200 patients with suspected cardiac amyloidosis or with a putative
diagnosis of cardiac amyloidosis but with remaining diagnostic uncertainty
(e.g., unclear etiology and/or cardiac manifestation) or patients with
diagnosis of amyloidosis but unclear cardiac involvement need to be
enrolled (FAS).
The Per Protocol Analysis Set for the primary efficacy analysis will comprise
patients diagnosed with cardiac AL and non-cardiac AL (disease controls).
Enrolment will be stopped and primary efficacy analysis will be performed
when 48 cardiac AL patients and 48 non-CA AL patients underwent
[18F]florbetaben PET and have received a SoT diagnosis of AL-CA or non ALCA,
respectively.
